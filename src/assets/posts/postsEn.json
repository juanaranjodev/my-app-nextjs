What is noteworthy, for this new year, is that programming and technology development will take another leap up the evolutionary ladder into fertile ground where once again companies will be able to develop initiatives to deepen their roots in their sectors or extend their business branches into new opportunities.\n\n## What should we watch out for in this new landscape?\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, digital transformation will continue to be a central pillar on which companies will seek to maximize the digitization of their processes through emerging technologies and the improvement of their customers' experience by creating more efficient and immersive applications.\nSo, 2024 will be a scenario in which we will see the deployment of new technologies, while others will continue to grow as a trend for the fulfillment of the above. This will be the highlights:\n\n### AI and ML-based applications.\n\nThe deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) tools to develop applications will continue to become more popular in the enterprise environment, as advantages such as personalization, automation and decision making will be better exploited, making them more common on the mobile devices of their audiences.\n\n### Cloud application development:\n\nCloud services have demonstrated a high degree of robustness and trust for businesses that have relied on them and this is why they will be a dominant trend this year. Businesses deploying this type of architecture will be able to improve scalability, flexibility and efficiency in both the development and deployment of their applications.\n\n### Agile Development Methodologies and DevOps:\n\nThe adoption of agile methodologies and DevOps practices will continue to be crucial to accelerate development cycles, improve cross-team collaboration, and ensure the continuous delivery of high-quality applications.\n\n### Focus on UX\n\nThe user is the raison d'Ãªtre of an application, and user interaction is a crucial factor in achieving user acceptance and preference. As a rule, applications must offer intuitive, fast and personalized interfaces if they are to stand out in a highly competitive and growing market. To achieve this, companies will be able to rely on data collection and analysis tools.\n\n### Sustainable and ethical development:\n\nThe global environmental agenda will impose the necessary parameters for companies to create applications that minimize their environmental impact and resolve ethical issues related to user privacy.\n\n## What will be the most profitable app segments?\n\nIn the application development industry, there are sectors or segments that, due to their relevance or impact on human life, become markets capable of generating large profit margins for companies that meet their needs through customized developments.\n\nAccording to the above, these will be the most profitable areas to develop applications in 2024:\n\n**Online health:** Apps dedicated to health, care and wellness will experience a significant increase in their offerings due to the growing demand for healthcare services through digital means.\n\n**Virtual education:** Online learning and educational apps will become even more profitable due to the growing social acceptance of distance learning models.\n\n**eCommerce and FinTech:** E-commerce and financial technology platforms will grow strongly as the digitization of transactions and mobile financial services are a demand of the modern user.\n\nTo close, developing applications is a task that will always be determined by the continuous technological evolution, and in that sense the search for innovative business solutions must be a priority if we seek to meet the growing demands of the market and stand out in it.\n\nTo achieve this, we believe in a close and balanced relationship of collaboration between professional teams, the adoption of emerging technologies and an ethical and productive approach to the design and development of applications. Since, according to our forecast, these will be key aspects to achieve success in 2024.\n\nTherefore, we want you to see in us a strategic ally for your company, since we have the professional team and the necessary experience to provide the most profitable solutions to the commercial challenges that the new year will propose.

Low-Code/No-Code Platforms\n\nAccording to data from the consulting firm Garner, it is expected that by 2024 more than 65% of the applications developed will be created under these platforms, which are digital tools that allow users with diverse technical skills and minimal or no code writing to generate highly attractive and functional applications.\n\nDue to these characteristics, these platforms are expected to become increasingly popular in the SME environment and within the entrepreneurial communities, thanks to their low operating cost and their ability to accelerate the development of pro-business applications.\n\n## 2. Holographic interfaces\n\nA holographic interface is a virtual interaction system that allows users to interact with elements and data in three-dimensional environments which are generated by holographic technologies.\n\nThese holograms are digital representations of objects or information in real spaces which will allow application designers a much more immersive visual and tactile experience for their users.\n\n## 3. UX customizable\n\nCustomizable user experiences (UX) are the set of interfaces and interaction systems that allow users to adapt and adjust various aspects of the application according to their own individual preferences.\n\nThrough artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning it is possible to deeply analyze the behavior and particularities of users, which will provide developers with highly valuable information to achieve new levels of satisfaction for their users.\n\n## 4. Minimalistic navigation\n\nMinimalist navigation is a compendium of web design and user interface creation practices that seeks to simplify navigation structures and reduce the number of visible elements on the screen.\n\nIt is based on the premise that less is more to focus on the essentials, focusing on delivering clearer and more direct navigation experiences by dispensing with unnecessary elements to transform any interaction into a more pleasant and accurate experience.\n\nIn this context, it is highly possible to live in 2024 a boom period for applications navigable only through gestures or finger movements.\n\n## 5. Microinteractions\n\nDigital microinteractions are all those short-lived animations or visual and state responses which provide feedback to users after interacting with the interface of a mobile application or a website.\n\nThese small responses are very meaningful to the user and are essential to improve the user experience, giving way to a better sense of response to any action by the user within the app scheme.\n\n## 6. Multiplatform development\n\nCross-platform development aims to create software applications that can run on multiple platforms or operating systems, without requiring significant code rewriting for any of these environments.\n\nThis allows developers to rely on tools such as Flutter or React Native to design and program single code packages which with a few adjustments can be deployed on different operating systems or platforms to save time and resources in each deployment.\n\n## 7. Blockchain for security\n\nBlockchain is a relatively new technology that, in 2023, thanks to its applications in systems verification, transparency and data protection, has managed to position itself as a fundamental pillar for security and digital integrity with a wealth of benefits for multiple industries and sectors.\n\n## 8. SuperApps\n\nAll-in-one platforms are very popular in Asia but this approach is gaining traction in the West where more and more digital service providers are looking to make more useful and robust applications for their users.\n\nAt a general level, the term 'SuperApps' refers to any mobile application that offers multiple services and functionalities under a single umbrella to become a one-stop solution for the diverse needs of its users.\n\nThis means that, instead of having several apps for specific tasks, users will be able to access the service they are looking for, from messaging and payments to online shopping and delivery services, within one SuperApp [read more](https://www.dreamcodesoft.com/es/blog/contributions-superapps-do-to-the-business-world), which contains, protects and delivers their personal information in each procedure.\n\nIn conclussive words, as 2024 approaches we see how the development of applications enters a stage of technological transformation which will undoubtedly bring us many surprises and innovative twists that had not been possible until now.\n\nTherefore, it is important to stay informed about the trends that converge in the heart of our changing industry, in order to evaluate their strategic incorporation in the development of our businesses.\n\nThank you for reaching this point, we invite you to visit our website and make use of our technological services focused on business growth.

Understanding this is critical to creating applications with high growth potential.","read":"5 - 10 min","date":"December 08, 2023","url":"reactjs-or-reactnative-which-one-to-choose-for-your-project","imglink":"reactjs-or-reactnative-which-one-to-choose-for-your-project.webp","category":"innovation","content":"\nWhen you start the initiative to develop an application, the evaluation of the right technology is a fundamental step to ensure the success of your project.\n\nIn that sense, ReactJS and React Native, developed by Facebook, are two of the most popular, which share the same component-based development approach, but are designed for applications in very different contexts.\n\nRoughly speaking, ReactJS is commonly used for web applications and React Native is geared towards creating mobile applications, but this is not absolute in either case. Therefore, in this article we will delve into the differences between these two powerful languages, and how to best approach choosing one or the other according to your project.\n\n## ReactJS\n\nEssentially, ReactJS is a JavaScript library that is used by development teams to build interactive and dynamic user interfaces in web applications.\n\n### Its advantages:\n\n- **Reusability:** ReactJS is based on the creation of reusable components which can be assembled and reused in different parts of the code to save time and effort in development.\n\n- **Virtual DOM:** ReactJS uses a Virtual DOM to efficiently update the user interface just by making the necessary changes where you want to make an improvement.\n\n- **SEO Friendly:** ReactJS is SEO friendly, meaning your web application will be easily indexable by search engines, which is essential for your online visibility.\n\n- **Community and ecosystem:** ReactJS has a very active collaborative community. It also has a robust library and collection of support resources, which makes development and troubleshooting easier.\n\n### Disadvantages\n\n- **Mobile nativity:** ReactJS is not specifically designed for mobile applications, so it does not provide a native experience, although this is not restrictive.\n\n- **Hardware control:** ReactJS runs in a web browser and this limits its control over the hardware of the device where it is accessed.\n\n## React Native\n\nIn contrast, React Native is designed for native mobile app development on iOS and Android, allowing it to adapt to different environments.\n\n### Advantages\n\n- **Multiplatform development:** React Native allows you to build mobile apps for iOS and Android using a single code base.\n\n- **Native experience:** Unlike packaged web apps, React Native apps offer a native user experience on mobile devices, although users cannot distinguish between one and the other.\n\n- **Hardware access:** React Native provides direct access to the device's hardware to take advantage of its proprietary features.\n\n- **Performance:** React Native apps offer performance comparable to native apps, thanks to their optimization and use of native components.\n\n### Disadvantages\n\n- **Learning:** Although React Native uses JavaScript, learning it can be complex for developers who are not familiar with mobile concepts.\n\n- **Dependency:** Sometimes, you need to use native modules or third-party libraries to access certain features, which can add complexity to your project.\n\n## So when to choose ReactJS and when to choose React Native?\n\nIn this context, it all depends on the nature of your project. But, on a general level:\n\n### Choose ReactJS if:\n\n- You need to develop a web application or a web platform.\n\n- You want to take advantage of component reuse to achieve faster development.\n\n- Your goal is to create an app for multiple platforms, not just mobile.\n\n### Choose React Native if:\n\n- You want to create a native mobile app for iOS and Android.\n\n- You need to emphasize native user experience and device functionality.\n\n- You need shared code for multiple mobile platforms.\n\n## Final words\n\nTo close, both technologies are powerful and supported by an active community, which will facilitate your development and scalability of your app.\n\nSo, choosing between ReactJS and React Native for your project will depend on certain aspects of your development, as well as your technical skills.\n\nFinally, if you are looking to develop a web or mobile application that will allow you to reach new markets or find new business opportunities, visit [Services](https://www.dreamcodesoft.com/en/services) and rely on our professional team to create a true digital solution for your company.\n"},{"id":1695013200,"title":"Native apps VS progressive apps, how to choose the best?","metaTitle":"Native apps VS progressive apps, how to choose the best?","meta_description":"Native apps VS progressive apps, a complex decision that would allow companies to improve engagement and user experience by developing their own apps directly for mobile devices.","read":"5 - 10 min","date":"September 18, 2023","url":"native-apps-vs-progressive-apps-choosing-the-best-one-for-your-technology-initiative","imglink":"native-apps-vs-progressive-apps-choosing-the-best-one-for-your-technology-initiative.jpg","category":"innovation","content":"\nStatistical information on the consumption of content using mobile devices by users affirms what was already evident: twice as much content is consumed on these devices than on desktop computers. This raises a scenario which proposes to companies to improve user engagement and user experience by developing applications directly for mobile devices.\n\nIn that sense, obviating web applications, the options to overcome this challenge are clear: develop a native app or a progressive app. Now, recommending one over the other requires a thorough analysis of the needs of your business and its market, but so you can have a better idea about what type of application is the best option to develop in your company, we have created this comparative article in which we will describe the characteristics of native apps and progressive apps, from the perspective of both programmers and users.\n\n## Native apps\n\nGrosso modo, a native app is a technological solution designed and developed specifically for a particular operating system such as iOS or Android, to cite references. These are developed through focused or native languages of the platform on which the application will run, this allows to achieve optimal performance and full access to the functionality of the devices, taking better advantage of the hardware available and the characteristics of the operating system that supports them.\n\n## Progressive apps\n\nAs with native apps, progressive apps offer an optimal and fully usable user experience. The difference between these two types of application is that progressive apps are a hybrid between web apps and native apps, producing a combination of the best of both environments.\n\nIn this way, progressive apps manage to deliver state-of-the-art user interfaces, with automatically adaptive designs and with better speed than native apps. In addition, these apps work offline and do not require prior installation on users' devices.\n\n## Native Apps vs Progressive Apps\n\nIn this parallelism, both users and developer teams have their own view or feeling about the impact of native apps or progressive apps at an interdependent level. Accordingly, it is possible to highlight the advantages or strengths of one over the other if we take into consideration the perspective of each of these roles within the app lifecycle.\n\n### From the user's perception\n\n**Download and installation:**\nNative apps require an app store and installation of their packages on devices, while progressive apps do not require the above.\n\n**Performance and capacity:**\nProgressive apps load much faster but native apps are more robust as they rely on the underlying operating system of the device hosting it.\n\n**Functionality:**\nProgressive apps depend on the existence of various APIs that allow them to run certain sub-processes to provide the same functionalities that native apps are able to deliver out of the box.\n\n### From the developer's perception\n\n**Programming language:**\n\nNative applications are written in the most appropriate programming languages according to the operating system on which they will be installed. Progressive applications are programmed to run in web browsers.\n\n**Project cost:**\n\nA native application requires different versions for each operating system, therefore the same must be applied for its updates. Progressive applications run in browsers regardless of the operating system of the user's device.\n\n### Deployment and distribution\n\nTo distribute a native application it is necessary to have its different versions according to the operating systems of its users while to deploy a progressive web application only a web browser and a URL are needed.\n\n## Native or progressive, which type of app to choose?\n\nAccording to the above, both native and progressive apps have certain features that can be considered as advantages or disadvantages in their contexts. So, if you are looking to determine which type of app is better for your company, these are our recommendations:\n\n### Native application when:\n\n- You need to use specific native device features to run your app.\n\n- You want to increase your company's credibility on a larger scale.\n\n- You need to collect better information from your target audience in a natural way.\n\n### Progressive web application when:\n\n- You need a simple app for your user.\n\n- You don't have the time or capital to develop a native app.\n\n- You want to improve the SEO (search engine optimization) of your business website.\n\nNow, if you still have questions or queries that require a better understanding of your business, it is necessary to analyze your situation with good business and technological judgment, using the most appropriate criteria to assess the feasibility of each scenario according to your current business.

This has opened the door to a world of benefits for businesses, which today enjoy better decision making in operational, executive and administrative scenarios, regardless of their size or industry.\n\nConsequently, we can estimate that data has become the most valuable raw material that a company has to produce better results in its initiatives, therefore ensuring its storage, management and availability should be considered as a critical objective for the business and data centers are the best strategic ally to achieve it.\n\n## A look inside a data center\n\nA data center is a physical facility that houses storage equipment and server networks that are interconnected for the purpose of storing data, processing it and distributing the information obtained quickly and securely to whoever needs it.\n\nWithin the operating cycle of a data center, servers are high-performance computer equipment that work to manage and process data. This data is stored on solid state drives (SSD), hard disk drives (HD) and disk arrays (RAID) to ensure data preservation in any scenario.\n\nConnections between processing equipment, storage units and the web rely on high-capacity networks, which have a high data throughput rate to store, share and preserve their users' information.\n\nIn other sections, these dedicated facilities have their own systems to properly manage the hardware that makes up the data center and in turn allow them to maintain their operation continuously and free of obstacles. Also, if required, data centers are scalable and have the ability to expand and adapt to offer more resources to meet a given demand for both storage and processing.\n\nToday, these data centers play a fundamental role in the existence and execution of all kinds of applications and other online services such as cloud computing. In this way, they have become fundamental systems for the operational infrastructure of many companies and businesses around the world.\n\n## The strategic value of a data center\n\nTaking into account the imperative relevance that exists around information and its proper management in today's business landscape, these are the scenarios where a data center can contribute to the success of business operations today:\n\n### Centralized storage and management.\n\nHosting, processing and managing business-critical enterprise information is an advantage that directly impacts on improved operational efficiency at multiple levels and high savings in time and economic capital.\n\n### Digital security\n\nPeace of mind for the business operation is a managerial advantage that comes from the assurance and protection of information from any breach thanks to the layers of security that data centers possess.\n\n### Redundancy and preservation\n\nThe use of various storage systems provides the necessary redundancy so that data is always available for any call. This allows information to be recovered and preserved in the event of a cyber attack or operational failure.\n\n### Scalability\n\nFor those companies that experience accelerated growth or a peak in their operational demand, scalability is an advantage that data centers use to adapt to the particularities of the business in order to guarantee their productivity in any scenario, without the need for a new infrastructure.\n\n### Cost reduction\n\nBy using the services of a data center provider, companies can avoid the high costs of storing and processing information internally. This frees them from the need for storage and interconnection infrastructures, professional staff and maintenance costs associated with setting up their own data center.\n\n### Increased credibility\n\nBy relying on the services of a data center, companies will be able to devote their efforts to other areas than improving the delivery of their products and services, which will have a positive impact on their customers' perception and enhance their brand reputation within the market.\n\n## Our conclusion\n\nWith the growing need to deliver better user experiences as a key tool to increase profitability, companies are challenged to find a balance between their operational and commercial tasks, which are so changing today. In this sense, data centers are capable of providing what is necessary to satisfy productivity in different business areas.\n\nThus, opting for an integral solution that makes flexible and enhances the fulfillment of business objectives, will position the company towards success.\n\nTherefore, if you need technological advice for your company, make sure you have a reliable professional team that connects your objectives with the best solution according to your market and target.

This also applies to the business and industrial sectors where we have witnessed the great transformations that this technology is promoting.\n\nIn that sense, today we will review in this article a new approach proposed by Artificial Intelligence: the creation or development of applications by means of this disruptive technology.\n\n## The current scenario\n\nLet's start by clarifying that in the technological present, developing applications solely with artificial intelligence (AI) is a rare approach in the industry. Although AI has advanced significantly in recent years and has proven to be useful in various applications, there are still limitations in terms of the capabilities and maturity of its systems.\n\nWhile artificial intelligence can be used to automate diverse tasks of all kinds, creating applications still requires a multidisciplinary approach and human intervention in many aspects.\n\nThis puts human developers first, as they are essential for understanding business requirements, designing the application architecture, making strategic decisions and solving complex problems that may arise during development.\n\n## Addressing app development with AI\n\nIn general terms, artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted application development is an approach that uses the techniques and capabilities of AI-based systems to take over the process of designing, programming and deploying applications.\n\nIn this way, AI would be in charge of activities such as automating specific tasks, improving the efficiency of processes, and finding the most effective solutions throughout the entire lifecycle of an application's creation.\n\nNow, answering the question of how viable it is for companies to develop applications solely with AI, there are several challenges involved in the creation of an application and the following are the most appropriate ones that can be addressed by this technology.\n\n## Automatic code generation\n\nThanks to the use of machine learning and natural language processing techniques, AI can understand both the specifications and the requirements of the application and thus generate the source code that meets those specifications in an efficient way. This can certainly save time and effort throughout the development process\n\n## Automated testing\n\nAutomating application quality testing is a simple task for AI because AI is able to set up and generate several test cases, run them, monitor them and analyze the results more efficiently and accurately than manual testing.\n\nIn addition, AI can also learn from the results of these tests to continuously improve the quality of applications to detect potential errors and problems.\n\n## User interface design assistance\n\nThanks to machine learning, AI tools can be of great help in user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design because it can analyze design patterns and user preferences as well as best practices to offer suggestions and recommendations for improving UI/UX design in order to create more intuitive and attractive interfaces for users.\n\n## Personalization and recommendations\n\nIn the practice and execution of an application, AI can personalize the user experience based on user preferences and behavior. In addition, it can analyze user data such as location, previous activities, and user preferences, so it can make decisions to tailor the application and its content to better satisfy its user.\n\nIn short, AI-assisted application development streamlines and improves the application development process, increases software quality, and provides more personalized and efficient experiences for users. By leveraging AI capabilities, companies can accelerate application development, reduce costs, and deliver products of higher quality and value. However, application development poses a framework of technical, functional and design issues that go beyond the current capabilities of AI.\n\n## Now, the answer to the headline\n\nWhile artificial intelligence can be a powerful tool for application development, it is more viable for businesses to consider it as an aid or assistant rather than relying solely on it for end-to-end application development.\n\nThis is where the combination of human skills and AI capabilities can provide more robust, balanced and cost-effective results, as understanding business requirements, development approach and managing certain ethical and legal aspects remain essential elements in the development of successful applications that rely entirely on human resources.\n\nThus, AI is positioned as a high-value tool capable of improving and streamlining certain aspects of the process of creating applications, but for now there is still a long way to go before it completely replaces human intervention in application development.\n\nTo conclude, remember that if you want to develop an app and take advantage of the benefits that artificial intelligence can bring to your business, our technology team is ready to advise you [at](https://www.dreamcodesoft.com/en/services)\n"},{"id":1687410000,"title":"ChatGPT and its disruptive entry into the technology industry and business of 2023","metaTitle":"ChatGPT and its disruptive entry into the technology industry and business","meta_description":"ChatGPT is defined as a chatbot platform based on artificial intelligence but it was not until this year, 2023, when its third iteration (ChatGPT 3) took a definitive leap in its evolution, becoming a disruptive tool for industry and business.","read":"5 - 10 min","date":"June 22, 2023","url":"chatgpt-and-its-disruptive-entry-into-the-technology-industry-and-business","imglink":"chatgpt-and-its-disruptive-entry-into-the-technology-industry-and-business.jpg","category":"innovation","content":"\nAt the end of 2022, the official launch of the third iteration of ChatGPT, the artificial intelligence chatbot created by OpenAI, surprised the world with the scope of its technology in the global business spectrum.

Therefore, creating websites that fully meet the needs and capabilities of the devices from which they will be accessed is a standard that all programmers oriented to mobile development cannot fail to meet.\n\nIn this context, this article will cover five current techniques of responsive web design to achieve high level of adaptability and visual quality developments.\n\n## What is Responsive Design?\n\nWhen it is said that a website has responsive design or responsive, basically it is saying that its visual structure is correctly adapted to the resolution of the screen on which it is being displayed. In this way it manages to deliver to its visitors an optimized and improved UI/UX experience, which positively impacts on increasing traffic to the site, decreases bounce rates and improves its positioning among other benefits.\n\n## The responsive design techniques that best respond to brand positioning\n\n### 1. Remove obstacles to the visitor\n\nMake sure there is no friction between the user's navigation and their goal, if they want to buy help them achieve it in a few steps.\n\n### 2. Lean on native hardware\n\nTake advantage of the resources that mobile devices can provide you with, these are integrated cameras, GPS, two-step authentication, etc.\n\n### 3. Program with fluidity and adaptability as main objectives\n\nFor example, you can rely on the use of SVG images that do not lose quality if they are enlarged or reduced.\n\n### 4. Design for the thumb\n\nFor desktop websites the navigation is usually at the top, on mobile it should be at the bottom.\n\n### 5. Consider typography as the ultimate detail.\n\nmake font sizes adapt directly proportional to the resolution of the screen where the website is projected.\n\nTo close, 94% of visitors rate it according to its delivery and responsiveness and more than 60% do it from mobile. These are enough reasons for DreamCode to have a team of high-level developers with the knowledge and experience necessary to develop responsive sites that provide the best experience for your visitors and attract more qualified traffic according to your business objectives.

Moreover, in practice it is a fluent and complete language that provides everything needed to produce digital solutions of high commercial value","read":"5 - 10 min","date":"January 25, 2023","url":"developing-HTML5-apps","imglink":"developing-HTML5-apps.jpg","category":"innovation","content":"\nA growing trend indicates that both companies and programmers are looking for technological innovation through the development of efficient, sustainable, scalable and, above all, low-cost web or mobile applications. This has brought into consideration the viability of HTML5 since it is a simple, versatile, developer-friendly and open source language, which means that it does not require any investment for professional use. For that reason, in this article we will break down roughly what is involved in developing mobile applications with HTML5 to better understand this technological trend.\n\n## What is an HTML5 app?\n\nHTML5 allows the creation of WORA (write once run everywhere) applications, which in Spanish translates as \"write once run everywhere\" applications that can be executed in any environment.\n\nStructurally, these apps are a collection of web pages based on HTML code which are delivered by means of CSS style sheets in conjunction with JavaScript. In this way HTML5 apps achieve the integration of different structure and design elements along with the necessary APIs for proper deployment on multiple devices and platforms.\n\n## Which are the pros and cons of developing HTML5 apps?\n\n### Pros\n\n**Learning and implementation**\n\nOn a general level, HTML is the starting point where developers begin their professional journey. This demonstrates its ease of learning and ensures that there will always be talent available for development compared to other languages.\n\n**Investment and profitability**\n\nHTML5 does not require royalty payments to be implemented in professional projects. In addition, its cross-platform deployment prevents companies from having to develop native applications for each platform.\n\n**Adaptability and integration**\n\nHTML5 applications adjust to the resolutions, screen sizes and aspect ratios where they run. They also integrate seamlessly with the operating system of any device.\n\n**Maintenance and Upgradeability**\n\nThe clean, clean code achieved with HTML5 ensures easy-to-maintain applications. Also, updating it is uncomplicated and requires no action on the part of users.\n\n### Cons\n\n**Permissions and access**\n\nHTML5 cannot access all the functionalities of cell phones, in fact it can only do so through APIs and this can limit its capabilities and advantages over native applications.\n\n**Communication and deployment**\n\nHTML5 was developed quickly and has not yet solved some compatibility bugs in the deployment of CSS attributes, HTML tags and JavaScript APIs, this can generate communication failures on some devices.\n\nIn conclusion, despite having certain disadvantages, there are more successes that the development of HTML5 apps can achieve. This has motivated companies like Intel to generate campaigns to help programmers to achieve a transition from the native environment to the multiplatform environment proposed by HTML5.\nIf your company has the challenge of implementing one or more cross-platform mobile applications, HTML5 is probably the ideal language to face this task and overcome it with peace of mind, but first, you need to have the right team to develop this solution.\n\nSo, if you are looking to transform this business challenge into an opportunity for progress, it's time to meet us and schedule a consultation so that together we can work on the technological initiative that will take your company to a new level of services and benefits.

Before we continue, to make clear what each of these two terms in the technology industry mean, we leave the link to an article we previously [developed for this purpose](https://www.dreamcodesoft.com/en/blog/ui-ux-crucial-components-for-development-high-value-web-applications)\n\n## User Experience as a basis for Software Development\n\nThe intention of developing custom software is to promote effectiveness, availability, usability, practicality and, above all, the satisfaction of a bilateral technological need. The approach proposed by UX concepts is able to take this to a new level, and this is how companies demonstrate a genuine concern for their competitiveness, their customers and their perception of their developments.\n\nWhen implementing a UX approach within a custom software development initiative, it is imperative to include within the toolkit, to serve the end user, the creation of intuitive menus, the application of organizational logic in functions, the hierarchization of services, the structuring of interaction paths and, finally, the careful integration of corporate values.\n\nIn this sense, it is extremely necessary and favorable to make use of the knowledge of the users as a key resource for the reduction of errors, the precision of the objectives, the executive planning and the increase of productivity in the development cycles.\n\nThe above, if properly proposed and applied, is able to promote a better acceptance of the software by the users because it helps them to solve their needs quickly and fluently, making them feel skilled and competent in the use of technology because they are able to focus on meeting their objectives without worrying about the technical aspects of the application. In parallel, custom software developments work intuitively and without errors, and this optimal level guarantees a leap in business productivity leading to better results and higher revenues.\n\n## The impact of UX on business technology development\n\n### Assimilation and trust\n\nDowntime caused by the learning curve of a new application is often the main reason why companies are reluctant to take the initiative to change their software. But, if the software has been developed according to current requirements and protocols, and its use is smooth and effective, its learning curve will be short and effective.\n\n### Brand positioning\n\nThe perception of a brand in the human brain is a determining psychological factor for business prosperity. Consequently, a properly programmed and designed application has the ability to become a driver of customer loyalty and, in contrast, a UX error has the potential to generate significant consumer churn.\nInternally, through customized software, UX manages to convey the corporate spirit of the company to its employees with subtlety and precision. This optimizes the fulfillment of activities and improves response times to eventualities.\n\n### Business credibility\n\nAccording to HubSpot agency statistics, 97% of a customer's affirmative decision is influenced by the experience with the product. In other words, users tend to take details into account and this is why UX can turn them into loyal or lost customers. This is because custom development implicitly demonstrates that companies care as much about their customers as they do about their employees by providing them with better tools to do their jobs.\nIn summary, a UX solution may require a significant financial investment, but once it is operational it will speak volumes about the company's commitment to delivering on its business promises. As a result, the effect of creating UX-based applications is capable of transforming customers into brand ambassadors.\n\n### Financial profitability\n\nAll of the above is intended to deliver high-value technology solutions to both customers and employees, but the ultimate indicator of the viability of a UX-based development should be measured in terms of sales and/or acquisitions. In that sense, the benefits of user experience for companies are so versatile and heterogeneous that they can promote a better interaction with customers by optimizing the reduction of times in their requests, the increase of items in shopping carts and the higher speed in their transactions among many others.\n\n## Addressing the User Experience (UX) to build software\n\nAlthough it does not directly pertain to us, the world of video games turns out to be a great source of strategies if you are looking to create a positive user experience in the business world. Consequently, gamification is a quite useful approach from the premise that as human beings we are naturally programmed to seek a reward for every effort.\nTherefore, a custom application can provide a sense of victory after every interaction so that your users stay motivated and thus continue to use the application until their needs are met.\n\nNowadays, there are several software architecture and development models that have been carefully detailed to properly implement the UX approach in the creation of high quality and high value customized software for its users. However, it is still best to adopt a critical thinking mentality in terms of design but in parallel implement Agile development principles while developing the ultimate user experience.\n\nIn a general framework, the purpose of developing custom software that is based on the user experience is to create tools that are efficient, practical and above all capable of promoting corporate values. In this way, **user experience has become a business catalyst for companies that take the initiative to improve their software**. This is as long as all the fundamentals of UX are adopted and implemented for the creation of accurate and effective software models for task accomplishment and customer satisfaction.\n\nIf your business is looking to modernize its technological tools for both its employees and its customers in order to raise their quality, improve satisfaction rates and increase the number of transactions, at DreamCode we have the professional team and the right background to develop the UX-based application that your company needs.\nGet to know our services and schedule now a technological consultancy in which we can find the best alternative to position your company and increase its profitability.

In this article, you will discover the trends that will shape the coming year in terms of application development.\n\nIn this way you will have information at hand that will allow you to evaluate the next strategic movements in the face of your digital competitors.\n\n## 2023: Top 10 App Development Trends\n\n### 1. UI/UX at its best\n\nClear interfaces and minimalist designs are most appreciated by application users. This is because nowadays we use our devices for much more complex tasks than making calls, checking emails, scheduling appointments or using the calculator. In addition, the rise of foldable mobile devices and the advent of 5G technology will give a new dimension to the interaction between users and applications. For this reason, a correct and well-cared UI/UX approach can give your application the necessary sufficiency to improve the experience of its users.\n\n### 2. The growth of voice search\n\nVoice commands have conquered users causing the market to grow abruptly and it is expected that by 2026 it will reach an estimated value of 27.16 billion US dollars. It is clear that this technology will be a trend that will bring many novelties by 2023.\n\n### 3. The demand for cross-platform applications\n\nThe high costs and the limited purpose of applications limited to a platform are forcing companies to seek better alternatives for the digitization of their products and services globally and not unilaterally. Thanks to the multiplatform application approach, costs can be reduced and profitability increased by covering a greater spectrum of users within your market thanks to the same source code for all platforms.\n\n### 4. The rise of extended reality\n\nTechnologies such as augmented reality and virtual reality await a better environment to be deployed more efficiently and thanks to the implementation of 5G technology this will be possible.\n\n### 5.

Thanks to its accelerated data delivery and wide coverage, the large-scale implementation of this new technological standard is expected to transform our reality.\n\n### 6. SuperApps are gaining ground\n\nThe super applications are nothing more than a conglomerate of smaller and more specific services or applications according to their functionality. These robust applications will raise the centralization of activities such as messaging, online shopping, banking, transportation and food service, among many others. This with the purpose of accelerating and facilitating the acquisition of goods and services in an increasingly fast world.\n\n### 7. Gamification based learning\n\nRecent and future generations tend to get bored easily and this is the foundation that enabled the development of entertainment based learning applications. So, if your plan is to develop an educational app, gamification will undoubtedly be a requirement to cover in the development plan.\n\n### 8. The rise of on-demand apps\n\nThe home services market currently has more than 22 million users and continues to grow. This means that personalization and immediate and individual satisfaction will dominate application development with the aim of giving users what they want when they want it and companies will have to find better ways to achieve this purpose in a timely manner.\n\n### 9. Blockchain gains ground\n\nThe growing application market in the context of digital finance has proven to be quite fertile ground for blockchain thanks to its ability to ensure security and transparency. This has led companies like HTC and Samsung to develop devices compatible with this technology.\n\n### 10. Mobile app development first\n\nInternet traffic is dominated by access from mobile devices, this does not mean that your company should transform its digital assets to the mobile ecosystem, but what would be productive is to start considering the characteristics of your customers and prospects to propose a mobile development approach if you are looking to have a real advantage over your competition.\n\nFinally, if your company seeks to capitalize on the trends of the new year, it is important to have a complete internal review of the organization that allows visibility of the areas in which the development of applications can bring competitive advantages.\n\nTo this purpose, at DreamCode we have a technology advisory service under which we analyze the situation of your company and its potential areas of technological innovation.

That was the case of Seguros BolÃ­var, one of the largest insurance companies in Colombia and one of DreamCode's current clients.\n\nIt has been an extensive journey full of valuable lessons. Today we want to share with you the highlights we discovered while working together, in order for you to rely on them for the challenges ahead for your company or independent projects. Join us as we look at the process we have been building with Seguros BolÃ­var as we move forward with technology projects in different areas of their operations.\n\n## Innovation in the middle of uncertainty\n\nIt has been two years since the Covid-19 pandemic reached Colombia. At that time, few companies were really prepared for the operational agility that this would represent. However, that wasn't the case for Seguros BolÃ­var, because, once they contacted DreamCode in early 2020, the migration of their technologies to state-of-the-art environments and some of their most ambitious customer-facing projects were put on the table.\n\nThis foresight was key to implement what had been previously discussed between both companies, initially we started with projects such as: the migration to the cloud of internal administrative systems, all thanks to our experience with this type of processes. This was the way in which the company was able to face the pandemic with solid foundations and obtain a high capacity to respond to changes.\n\nThe discussion and plans around innovation in this case were fundamental for Seguros BolÃ­var not to go through an unfavorable situation in the midst of such a vulnerable market as it was in the year 2020. This, added to the fact that the local government began to require companies to comply with the electronic invoicing requirement around that time, taking the company's vision a bit further, today we can see the benefits of broadening the scope of its technology.\n\n## Key services that are empowering the company\n\nSeguros BolÃ­var came to us with several significant challenges and several business dreams that will bring value to its customers and employees. The primary goal was to rebuild a 25 year old legacy core system (based on Oracle PLSQL and forms) using state-of-the-art technology such as cloud-native architectures, service and API-based integrations and data analytics to enable the digital transformation of the insurance company. Thus, through a detailed monitoring of the objectives and unique needs of each of the projects, we define together the methodology, structure and workflows to achieve success in each of the goals, assigning a group of experts related to each of them.\nSpecifically, we have collaborated on four projects: Ciencuadras.com, Jelpit Conjuntos, the mobile application BolÃ­var Conmigo along with electronic invoicing and the reconstruction of the insurance core. Next, we will focus on what we learned working on the first three:\n\n### Real estate platform Ciencuadras.com\n\nOne of Seguros BolÃ­var's main initiatives was to support the development of a web platform for users who wanted to search, rent or sell real estate. This project required special consideration, as the construction industry was not exactly going through its finest moment. After analyzing different approaches and methodologies, DreamCode took on the challenge of supporting the development of the web platform with key functionalities such as property search for buyers, sellers and renters, as well as supporting the addition of an important player to the platform: Constructora BolÃ­var (an allied company of Seguros BolÃ­var).\n\nOur development team employed the latest methodologies and best practices of agile software development, and along with the constant guidance of Seguros BolÃ­var and its allies, managed to have in full operation and in record time the platform [(www.ciencuadras.com)](https://www.ciencuadras.com/) that today has thousands of users in Colombia and from where the public can access the whole portfolio of the new projects from the construction company to compare their features and discover their advantages, as well as the properties, apartments or offices that users publish.\n\n### Jelpit Conjuntos web and mobile platform\n\nAs an integrated part of the Jelpit platform, Jelpit Conjuntos is a web solution offered in SasS (Software as a Service) modality that allows the administration offices of residential complexes to automate all their management processes. It is a unique solution in the market that has integrated modules such as: creation and management of accounts receivable and portfolio, administration of common areas, video conferencing facilities for meetings, resident portal, registration and monitoring of PQRs and administration of lease insurance.\n\nDreamCode's experienced human talent in web development and software architecture made this dream possible. It was through this application with best practices in the development of E-commerce environments and based on methodologies such as Agile Testing that we reached the product desired by the client and its end users, an app that today has many users.\n\nThe [site](https://www.jelpit.com) has stood out and continues to be relevant due to its high quality development, the acceptance by the public, the easy yet powerful interface and finally its constant evolution from the feedback provided by: users, Seguros BolÃ­var, our automated tests and a development team in constant communication.\n\n### BolÃ­var Conmigo\n\nWith the purpose of strengthening the relationship with their customers, Seguros BolÃ­var came up with the idea of merging many of their services in a mobile application for everyone, one \"Super App\" aimed to clients and also non clients, an application for anyone who wants to have a friendly solution for daily use. One of the main goals of BolÃ­var Conmigo is the health of people and the optimization of their daily habits, interacting with the health meters provided by smartwatches and some mobile device applications that most of us use on a daily basis. Thus, allowing us to keep in good shape through the counting of steps and overcoming healthy goals or challenges. Another two important modules of the Super App is the agile management of certain company products such as insurance related to mobility ( SOAT, all-risk insurance) and home.\n\nFrom DreamCode we have supported the app development in reference to its design and production, using the most advanced technologies for the app development and by working with interdisciplinary teams, combining developers and quality engineers, which worked hand in hand with different teams of Seguro BolÃ­var, thus achieving the integration of the different IT and technological systems necessary to achieve the dream of business.\n\n## We can conclude\n\nAmong all the projects that came about as a result of the investment in innovation, Seguros BolÃ­var can now say that it has obtained results that seemed very optimistic at the time, but in the end they became a reality thanks to a development process characterized by follow-up, constant feedback, agility in development, and highly reactive and productive teams.\n\nToday, DreamCode continues to provide the most innovative solutions in the sector in various Seguros BolÃ­var projects and, through its constant support and tangible results, the alliance between both companies continues to grow and aims towards new business ideas that will continue providing value and improving the users collaborators and associates lives.\n\n## About Seguros BolÃ­var\n\nSeguros BolÃ­var is a Colombian financial and insurance company founded in 1939.

So, if you are looking for a proper approach to tackle the design and development of applications for these novel and versatile devices, this article will be quite useful for you.\n\nSince the launch of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold cell phone in 2018, foldable devices became a new source of opportunities for developing innovative applications. This is because in the same device the user can enjoy new interactive experiences that are complementary thanks to the 3 folding functions that the screens of these mobiles have.\n\n## What can be interpreted from the statistics of the foldable devices market?\n\nStudies conducted throughout the world have made it clear that one of the most desired and expected features among the followers of smartphones is that they are foldable. But, before embracing this technology as the new universal trend, it is pertinent to clarify that foldable devices have been present in the market since 2018. The difference is that this time these terminals have matured in a more consistent and successful way achieving that their new functional proposal attracts waves of new users.\n\nSo, in order to help you resolve whether it is profitable for you or your company to embark on a path in which you seek to develop applications for these devices let's go directly to the statistical evidence, past, present and future:\n\n## At a general level\n\n- The global market for smartphones and tablets with foldable screens was valued at $91 million and is expected to reach or exceed $1550 million by the end of 2027\n\n- In 2019, shipments of foldable mobile devices consolidated at 1 million units globally. By the end of this year, the number of foldable mobile device shipments around the world is expected to reach the 50 million unit floor.\n\n- The foldable mobile device market is expected to reach a 64% year-on-year growth rate by 2025.\n\n## Specifically\n\n- In terms of screen size, it is estimated that those 6 inches or smaller will have a total market share of 44.6% by the end of this year. But growing demand and entertainment offerings are expected to position the 8-inch segment at 34.1% by 2031.\n\n- According to RAM memory capacity, the 12 GB RAM segment controls around 50% today, but a dominant jump is also expected from 16 GB RAM mobiles thanks to the adoption of IoT devices such as surveillance cameras, sensors and smart lights, among others, as these have driven the demand for higher storage capacity and faster data transfers.\n\n- As far as storage capacity is concerned, the most popular foldable mobile devices are 256 GB with a share of 60% at present. In this section a sudden jump is not expected given that the price gap between a 256 GB mobile and the immediately following 512 GB is quite wide and users are taking advantage of cloud services to supply their extra storage needs.\n\n- Finally, on the pricing front, the low availability and high demand for foldable mobile devices has positioned those in the USD 500 and USD 1500 range as the most popular, which dominate the current market with a share of more than 50%. However, this is expected to take another turn sooner rather than later given that this technology is quite young in the smartphone industry and very few brands have entered this niche market.\n\n## How to create applications for foldable screens?\n\nFoldable devices provide top-notch user experiences thanks to their flexibility in both hardware and software. This is undoubtedly a starting point for design and also for the development of high-quality applications with the purpose of creating engaging, immersive and versatile experiences for users of this technology.\n\n## Design-wise\n\nIn their nature, foldable devices have two physical and virtual states: folded screen and unfolded screen. When the screen is folded we can assume that it behaves like a traditional smartphone but when its screen is unfolded we talk about a tablet mode in form and behavior.\nFrom the above it should be considered:\n\n**One-handed and two-handed use:** In both cases the use is completely different so much so that in terms of UI/UX the two experiences are superficially the same but internally different, and this should be considered as a maxim in the design stage of development.\n\n**Continuity (of the screen):** As in the previous case the experience must be fluid as the user alternates between the folded and unfolded screen states.\n\n**Multiple windows:** The life cycle of multiple windows should be very well proposed to guide the user to the most convenient and useful according to their interaction.\n\n## Development:\n\nAt this stage, first and foremost, efforts should be made to create applications of the highest possible quality, which are fail-safe and flow flawlessly. They must also be extremely responsive.\n\n**Continuity (of the application):** This consideration is very similar to screen continuity, where the application must be free and able to move naturally as it moves from one screen state to another. This is achieved by creating dynamically sized viewports and resizable activity ports.\n\n**Variable screen proportions:** Having little information about the most appropriate screen sizes requires developing applications that support as many screen proportions and aspect ratios as possible.\n\n**Multiple window:** On foldable screen devices it is possible to run multiple applications simultaneously, so remember to include multiple resume capability in your application.\n\n**Multiple screen:** Yes, in addition to the folding screen these devices also support another screen in parallel so the application must be both adaptive and projectable.\n\nIn addition, once the design and development cycles are completed, the critical stage is the testing of functionality and adaptability. That is, it must be tested how well the application works per se, and how well it performs on a folding screen mobile. This in order to provide users with a solid and uniform experience because currently the audience reaction is quite positive and any inconvenience could limit the adoption of this type of devices.\n\nTo conclude, designing and developing an application for foldable mobile devices can prove to be quite a complex project but in return, if carried to fruition, it can easily become a success because users of these devices are expectant of the potential of this new stage of mobile telephony.\n\nIf you are looking to take a stake in this field, our advice is to seek technological guidance and rely on an expert development team to help you take commercial advantage of the new technological advances. For that reason, at DreamCode we can support you, on the one hand you can rely on our cutting-edge technology consulting and on the other hand, be confident that our developers will bring all their knowledge and experience in the development of profitable tools for your company.

Therefore, in this article we will review how the deployment of 5G networks has become the gateway to a new level of technological development.\n\n## What is 5G?\n\n5G is the new global wireless standard for mobile networks through which virtually everything would be interconnected, from machines, devices and objects in sectors such as health, education, security, finance, entertainment, mobility and, in general, all thanks to the power of 5G connections is something never seen before.\n\nThis mobile technology relies on OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) which is a model capable of modulating signals on multiple channels to avoid interference in their flow. It also makes use of better air transmission interfaces through wider bandwidths, which allows 5G technology to provide access to more people and objects.\n\n5G has been developed with the purpose of offering connection speeds of around 10 Gbps stable while having low latency (time taken by the network to transmit data). This translates into greater reliability, availability and outstanding performance, which improves the user experience allowing the entry and development of new industries.\n\nIn this context, its growth opportunities are almost infinite since 5G has the capacity to unleash a wave of disruptions in multiple sectors thanks to its transformative power. A clear example is the entertainment, health, education or automotive sectors, where we will soon be able to visualize animated holographic overlays in real time that will allow us to enjoy musical plays, sporting events, remote medical care, contemplate the representation of historical events or receive real-time instructions on how to assemble the parts of a car, all in a more vivid and immersive way.\n\n## The role of this technology in the development of augmented reality\n\nIt is said that the activation of 5G connectivity will be what marks the operational start of augmented reality, this due to its fast data transfer rates and limited interference in real-time visual reproductions. Given that augmented reality needs connections with higher bandwidths and low, if possible zero, interference, these are the two pillars of 5G on which it will be able to develop its true potential:\n\n### Ultra high speed:\n\nWith a download rate of around 10 GigaBytes per second (Gbps) versus 1 Gbps as the theoretical maximum available in 4G LTE-A networks (the fastest and most stable at present), real-time transfer of high-resolution data is expected to meet the requirements of augmented reality.\n\n### Ultra low latency:\n\nLatency is the time it takes for a data packet to reach its destination within a network from the time it initiated its request. In today's networks it averages 50 milliseconds (ms) and with 5G it should be reduced to a mere 10 ms. This is a key factor when the goal of augmented reality is to overlay information and virtual elements on real-world scenes in real time.\n\nOn a qualitative level, 5G networks are more reliable, capable, available and uniform allowing its users to access new experiences and engage with new industries. In this way it will bring benefits such as:\n\n- Advanced and remote medical care\n- More realistic video games\n- Non-face-to-face visits to real environments\n- Sports experiences without changing physical space\n- Telecommuting to a new level\n- More accurate and effective marketing\n\nIn colloquial terms, what augmented reality needs to reach new levels of deployment is to have an agile response from servers to user requests making use of today's top broadband speeds but this time on mobile networks.\n\n## How can enterprises and businesses capitalize on the potential behind the 5G architecture?\n\nConsidering that 5G networks have high range connections, low latency and quasi-infinite capacity, the activation and deployment of augmented reality will be widespread in both individuals and industries.\n\nAccording to recent publications from the World Economic Forum, augmented reality is one of the technologies that will reshape human interaction with the virtual world and this undoubtedly means that the business opportunities for corporate segments will be virtually endless, in short, we are opening the doors to a new world.\n\nAs a result, smaller companies will be able to compete with larger players in their sector because they will be able to access better technology and infrastructure without having to invest heavily. This will have an economic effect that will not only materialize augmented reality but will also impact the entire world economy.\n\n## What can we expect for the software development industry?\n\nSince before the implementation of 5G as a catalyst for technologies such as augmented reality, the arrival of this new standard is expected to drive innovation and promote a more competitive software market. It is also expected that many of the limitations that the software development industry currently has will disappear and this will allow on the one hand to rethink what we have created and on the other hand to consider what previously had no opportunity for development.\n\nIn the software development industry, solutions are limited by the technologies for which applications are created, therefore this new paradigm will set new limits under which both nearshore and offshore development teams will be able to add value in:\n\n- **Adding new functionalities to both sites and applications:**\n  With the possibility of bypassing speed and latency issues, development teams will be able to include new functionalities in their applications without being limited by performance, which is a guaranteed place for augmented reality.\n- **Implementing better quality images, audio and video:**\n  Implementing better quality images, audio and video.\n  The transmission of high quality content on mobile devices will be something never seen before. In addition, graphical sophistication and fluidity will increase the realism of video games and other virtual experiences.\n- **Increasing levels of digital security:**\n  Increased data transfer requires better security schemes for users' devices. This is why various biometric tools are currently being developed that will enable a more personalized level of security.\n- **Design and develop new levels of technological services:**\n  Applications that operate in real time will be able to benefit from a high rate of data transmission with which developers will be able to take firmer steps in services such as passenger transportation in driverless vehicles, robotic business logistics and intelligent traffic systems, among others.\n\nIn addition to the above, the software development industry will be transformed from its foundations because a new level of creative freedom implies a change of mentality and this in turn derives in a change of paradigms and processes under which a new era will begin for the programmers of the future.\n\nIn short, 5G connectivity is a milestone that will revolutionize the lives of both individuals and businesses by promoting its own revolution of other underlying technologies that are waiting for a wider and more stable data flow.\n\nIf your company is looking to prepare for the challenge of a new level of interconnectivity or if you are looking for the necessary support to develop the applications that will allow you to achieve your strategic objectives, DreamCode has a team of developers capable of designing and creating high performance solutions for your business.\n\nWe invite you to learn about all our services and to take a technology assessment to help you evaluate the key aspects that can improve your level of competitiveness in the face of new technologies.

For this purpose there are other more appropriate guidelines and therefore in this article we will explain roughly what is involved in the design of an IVU.\n\n## The pillars of user interface design\n\nDay by day the offer of voice-controlled devices grows both in quality and quantity and thanks to this irruption voice user interfaces such as Siri, Cortana, Google Assitant or Alexa are helping to improve all kinds of experiences related to their users.\n\nAccording to the above, the ideal starting point for designing a UI consists of UX designers executing research directly on end users according to the application they are looking to create. To achieve this, the global standard currently relies on the following guidelines:\n\n## User Journey.\n\nTaking voice as the only flow channel at this point the objective is to understand the prospective user's needs, behaviors and motivation in order to map their journey.\n\n## Competitive analysis\n\nKnowing and understanding how competitors implement and contextualize their voice interfaces is a key factor in developing an approach that takes advantage of the best of the current context and avoids falling into common mistakes.\n\n## Gather Requirements\n\nUser requirements are what will later cement the design specifications that will be delivered to the developers. To this end, it is quite useful to convert the interaction scenarios into user stories that will allow the development of future dialog flows.\n\n## Voice Command Anatomy\n\nThe user's voice commands are shaped by three variables that can be equated with each other: intent, expression and space. In other words, the purpose of the interaction, how the user expresses his request and in what context it is found are what will define the voice command and its possible responses.\n\n## Prototyping\n\nStarting from the requirements, designers are in charge of creating the dialog flows that will drive the interaction and trigger the responses. These flows are scripts that describe the two-way conversation between the user and the voice assistant.\n\n## UX analysis for the final product\n\nAt this point the IVU application is active and it is time to follow up on it to learn about the following metrics:\n\n- Interaction.\n- Language.\n- Messages, intentions and expressions.\n- Behavior patterns.\n\nFinally, as if it were a living being, the IVU learns, matures and evolves.\n\nConsequently, in the coming years VUIs will continue to gain ground to such an extent that we will be able to do without keyboards in about 10 years, according to some technology futurists. This highlights the enormous competitive potential of VUIs as long as they are properly integrated into existing enterprise products where they can add value.\nIn closing, it is important to note that at DreamCode we are business growth enhancers and our technology consulting services are available so that together we can integrate digital solutions that transform the user interface (UX) of your applications for maximum profitability for your business.

That explains why today we have apps for everything: health, education, shopping, sales, rentals, financial services, banking, government and emergencies among the most prominent.\n\nBut how is it possible for businesses of all sizes to create and maintain an app of their own?\nThe short answer is: because of the existence of progressive web apps.\n\n## So what are AWPs or, in English, PWAs?\n\nProgressive web apps (PWA) or progressive web applications (AWP) are software solutions that integrate the visual and functional structure of traditional (native) applications, but their infrastructure and operability are supported by current web technology. These applications are created from web languages such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript and their capabilities are incorporated or powered by state-of-the-art APIs to make them available and reliable on any device regardless of its platform (iOS, Android, etc).\n\nIn addition, these applications also leverage other important web ecosystem resources such as plugins, addons and community support to deploy and maintain their performance. This makes developing and and deploying a PWA relatively simple and fast, unlike native apps.\n\n## Other advantages of PWAs\n\n- They do not require third-party services such as Appstore or Google Play, only an Internet connection and a browser (Chrome, Opera or Safari among others).\n- They do not require extra space on the device. Installing them is basically creating a direct access to the web on our smartphones.\n- The user can continue to access all the content of the PWA even if he/she has lost the network connection.\n\n## What features make a PWA good:\n\n- **Responsive design:** A PWA should be usable on any device and on any screen size.\n- **Portability:** Although it is essentially a web application, a PWA should behave like a traditional application.\n- **Accessibility:** The user must be able to stay connected to the content even if he loses his connection in order to satisfy his direct need.\n- **Multi-platform:** PWAs are first and foremost democratic and hence their popularity, so they must be available on all possible browsers and platforms.\n\nThanks to all of the above, prominent companies such as Uber, Spotify, TikTok, Pinterest and Twitter currently offer their services through progressive web applications (PWA) and this popularity is enjoyed and appreciated by both companies and users.\nSo, if you are thinking of offering your business service through an app, it is time for you to meet our team of developers so that together we can build a solution that will raise the level of service of your company and increase its profitability.

Bearing in mind that cybersecurity is not a _hype_ within the technology industry and therefore should be a cross-cutting responsibility for users, creators and companies, we have created a list of the 5 most effective practices to create highly reliable software from day one.\n\n## Best business practices for secure development\n\n### 1. Consider the security of each development as a non-functional requirement.\n\nThis translates into estimating security needs in the early stages of web and mobile application development so that they are included in the sprints from the very beginning and not taken as a final step prior to the end of the development or delivery cycle.\n\n### 2. The security team must be included in the agile development process.\n\nWithin agile development platforms it is possible to mark development milestones as high-risk priorities so that security managers can address these segments of the software prior to partial delivery.\n\n### 3. Test security throughout the sprint\n\nAutomation is a great ally of application development and is also a great ally of software security. In this sense, it is also possible to include automated scripts and regression tests to test vulnerabilities and thus form a cycle that meets the conditions of zero risk.\n\n### 4. Choose the most appropriate agile approach to security.\n\nThis will ensure that, just as at the end of each cycle the applications are better, they are also more secure and reliable. This requires commitment and discipline because it is not yet a standardized practice at all levels in the technology development industry.\n\n### 5. Don't wait until digital security becomes mandatory.\n\nSecure development is a practice that must be taken seriously and for this there are tools such as roadmaps to do it in the best way. In other words, the means to create more secure applications already exist, now they need to be implemented.\n\nIf your company needs a digital solution to improve its competitiveness, keep in mind that a vulnerability can undo in an instant what was achieved in months of work. That is why our agile development approach is also secure and this is the guarantee that the solution we create for you will not only be profitable, but also reliable.

Planning and Analysis\n\nBased on client input, market research and technical information, senior team members assess the feasibility of the project. The terms of the project are then established according to cost estimates, the teams needed and their responsibilities within a schedule of activities.\n\n### 2. Requirements definition\n\nAccording to the functionalities and capabilities of the required software, the leaders and their teams establish the resources to be used. This information is documented by means of SRS (Software Requirement Specification) applications where all the design and development aspects that will be taken into account during the whole project life cycle are detailed.\n\n### 3. Design, architecture and prototyping\n\nFollowing the SRS document, designers and developers present the best possible structure to create the software. Usually more than one approach to approach the creation is proposed and this is included in detail in a DDS (Design Documentation System) document.\n\n### 4. Construction and development\n\nIt is time for the software to start its production phase. According to the size of the project and the DDS, this task can be performed by one or several developers. Here all the tools and resources foreseen are used so that the completion of the software is achieved in a detailed and orderly manner.\n\n### 5. Testing and adjustments\n\nOnce the software has been completed, the necessary pre-tests are initiated so that its defects are reported, tracked and retested to meet the product requirements and quality standards established in the SRS document.\n\n### 6. Deployment and maintenance\n\nIn this final stage the product is launched to the market under constant monitoring in which its availability and access are taken care of according to the growing database of its new users.\n\n## Most recognized and used models\n\n1. Waterfall\n2. Agile\n3. DevOps\n\nIt should be noted that there are other SDLC models, but the previous ones are the most recognized due to their simple implementation and optimal results in recent years. However, this information will be expanded by our team in future contents.\nFinally, the most relevant aspect of SDLC is the global vision it provides to developers and customers about the details of the project, its plan to fulfill them and the resources needed to complete it. It is important to keep in mind that in any initiative or technological need in your company it is essential to rely on solid and experienced teams, like the ones we have at DreamCode, to establish the best life cycle according to your project and your business objectives.

Moreover, it is also possible to develop all kinds of applications, as long as they provide value.\nThis has been the norm since the emergence of mobile devices, so applications have become one of the most profitable technology markets today and its growth is projected exponentially year after year. In recent studies, it is expected that mobile applications will generate (for owners and creators) around 935 billion dollars in revenues by the end of 2023, according to estimates by the global portal [statista](https://www.statista.com/forecasts/1262892/mobile-app-revenue-worldwide-by-segment).\n\nLikewise, given that there is an application for practically every human need and that all companies are looking to benefit from the creation of applications for their products and/or services, it is a reality that the demand for application developers has managed to exceed the current supply of these professionals.\n\n## How to choose the right language for mobile development?\n\nTaking into account that the adoption of an application (measured in number of downloads or active users) is what determines its success, we can say that mobile development depends both on our programming skills and our ability to evaluate and choose the right platform to build a functional and differential solution.\nSo, beyond finding or choosing a compatible programming language, our search should focus on finding the most appropriate technology to make our mobile application attractive, reliable, robust and innovative.\n\nBroadly speaking, this is the reason why in this article we have selected the five most popular programming languages for mobile development and we intend to help you choose the most suitable by reviewing their advantages and disadvantages for this purpose.\n\n## 1. JavaScript\n\nIt is said that JavaScript will continue to be relevant as long as we continue to use the Internet. Qualified as the most popular programming language today, JavaScript has demonstrated great versatility by allowing the development of web, mobile and cross-platform applications thanks to frameworks such as React. It is now possible to run it outside of browsers, as well as compile from other languages, making it a true _full-stack_ development language.\n\n### Advantages\n\n- Friendly and pleasant syntax for development.\n- Easy to control.\n- Versatile and flexible thanks to Node.js.\n- Fast and lightweight.\n\n### Disadvantages\n\n- Produces quite a lot of JS code fragments.\n- Can be easily broken.\n- Decreases execution performance of other software.\n- Its semantics can sometimes be inconsistent.\n\n## 2. Java\n\nSince 2008, Java has been the choice of choice for creating applications on the Android mobile platform because it can run on a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Most Android secondary languages are considered a version of Java or a different presentation of Java, this does not mean that this language is limited only to this platform, in fact Java is considered a multipurpose language.\n\n### Advantages\n\n- Object-oriented (OOP)\n- Traditional syntax similar to C, C++ and others.\n- Highly readable code.\n- Extensive library available online.\n\n### Disadvantages\n\n- Risk of bugs in your JVM virtual machine.\n- Bad libraries and complex syntax in certain scenarios.\n- Poor junk code collection.\n- Does not provide backup facilities.\n\n## 3. Swift\n\nIf you want to create applications for the iOS platform, a programming language created by Apple, it is the most suitable. Swift is a multipurpose and highly readable language on which you can program without major difficulties, the opposite of its predecessor Objective C, which was replaced by Swift as the official language for developing applications for Apple devices.\n\n### Advantages\n\n- Easy to read.\n- Interactive nature that saves time in development and compilation.\n- Its Xcode IDE is self-contained and if a library is included it simplifies the use of workspaces.\n- With Swift you can also develop server-side.\n\n### Disadvantages\n\n- The learning curve in Swift is higher with respect to other languages for iOS.\n- Its type checking is very strict and type errors will not allow compilations to be made.\n- It is relatively young and therefore not best suited for very robust applications.\n- It is somewhat unstable and requires periodic updates.\n\n## 4. Kotlin\n\nKotlin is a relatively new programming language that has managed in a short time to become the preferred language for application development on the Android platform. This has been created by Google and is a great alternative to Java, in fact it is the official language of Android applications.\n\n### Advantages\n\n- It is interoperable with Java which allows you to make more robust applications.\n- It delivers native level support while running on various platforms.\n- It is a very clear and concise language.\n- It allows to execute functional programming through lambdas.\n\n### Disadvantages\n\n- Being a new language the offers to learn it may not satisfy every type of user.\n- It has been said that Kotlin will become the successor of Java but for now it is far behind because its compilation times are two to three times slower than Java.\n- Its support and community have not been fully developed so the resources to solve problems are quite limited.\n- Primitive types like int, bool, long, etc. existing in Java are completely an illusion in Kotlin, this seems to be the justification for why interoperability between the two languages.\n\n## 5. Python\n\nPython is a powerful language capable of supporting the creation of web, mobile and desktop applications among many other developments. Among its most important products are YouTube, Instagram and Pinterest, demonstrating that Python is a solid platform for developing high-level applications thanks to its magnificent library, its high readability and easy learning, as well as its immense community.\n\n### Advantages\n\n- Guaranteed rapid development\n- Uses indentation to ensure fairly clean and neat code.\n- Easy to learn, use and deploy.\n- Has cross-platform and multi-system support.\n\n### Disadvantages\n\n- Its execution times fluctuate over time.\n- Upgrades are needed to develop modern mobile applications.\n- It is not recommended for large-scale developments.\n- Its level of access and data handling is outdated.\n\nIn conclusion, programming languages are tools that evolve as fast as we need them to, and this has allowed some of them to pass the test of time. Thanks to this dynamic, today we have ideal languages to build mobile solutions according to our goals and our skills, which allows us to save time and effort.\n\nFor this reason, at DreamCode we have a solid team of programmers ready to evaluate your needs in detail to choose the best programming platform that allows us to build a highly competitive technological solution for your company.

In a practical sense, this documentation is an explicit record of all the events or processes involved throughout the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).\n\nTherefore, in this article we have proposed to address this topic in order to help and encourage programmers to write better technical documentation for their future software developments, since it represents for both users and future programmers the correct way to use and maintain a technological product.\n\nFor developers, writing documentation is an uncomfortable job, but we are sure that it is more uncomfortable to have to read poorly documented code, or in the worst case, no documentation at all. Consequently, it is clear that when we write documentation for a product, we are doing it for the future developers who will interact with that product, not for us or for the team that was involved in its creation.\n\nSo, starting from the premise that all software products need technical documentation regardless of their complexity or the size of the team involved in their development, let's learn about their scope and the types of documentation that exist.\n\n## Aspects covered by technical documentation\n\nThe objective of technical documentation is to inform about the details that, according to our role, we need to know to understand and interact with the product. This is created from the phases contemplated in the software development life cycle (SDLC) or the stages of software development, which are:\n\n### - Planning\n\nIn this stage, according to the market research, the feasibility of the project, its associated risks, its costs and which functions and services will satisfy the target public are determined.\n\n### - Analysis\n\nThis phase is key to the requirements and needs of the users and how the technical details and specifications will deliver the value expected by these users. This process is executed in a clear framework in which responsibilities, deliverables and testing are anchored to a relevant schedule.\n\n### - Design\n\nThis stage is entirely dedicated to designers, architects and application developers who are tasked with studying implementation options to structure and build the ideal software. This phase is usually iterative because it is necessary to debug and refine the product plans before having a final design.\n\n### - Development and implementation\n\nStarting from a correct choice of tools such as appropriate programming environments, suitable languages, solid logics and global formats, the code starts to be developed by modules which are tested and approved until the application is finished.\n\n### - Testing\n\nThis is a phase of auditing and correction of a stable version of the application. In the field of development, it is said that a test is successful when errors are detected, so this is where the application will take its first steps and will be corrected iteratively before the end user can make full use of it.\n\n### - Implementation and maintenance\n\nAt the end of the cycle, the IT department's responsibility is to register the application, monitor it, maintain it and ensure that its functionality remains impeccable to guarantee the best performance for all users. At this stage there should certainly also exist for the consideration of updates and upgrades.\n\n## Types of technical documentation\n\nTechnical documentation is aimed at different audiences according to their relationship with the product taking into account whether they design, create, review, revise, correct or simply use the software. These are its types:\n\n### 1. Product requirements document.\n\nThis document should record all the information about the functionality of the application, taking into account commercial aspects, user experiences, use cases, etc. In addition, the purpose, functionalities, behavior and maintenance of the final product must be made clear.\n\n**Model**\n\n- Roles and responsibilities\n- Goals and objectives\n- Mission statement\n- Experiences and justification\n- Design and interaction\n- Questions\n- Tasks to be solved\n\n### 2. Software architecture document\n\nThis document clarifies and describes the architectural decisions about the infrastructure of the application. It describes the construction of the product in order to visualize and communicate the possible scenarios.\n\n**Model**\n\n- Overview and background\n- Design principles\n- User experiences and business objectives\n- Solution explanation\n- Milestones\n\n### 3. UX Design Document\n\nFor this document you must do a research or benchmark related to the expected application in order to create your prototypes, perform usability tests and adjustments.\n\n**Model**\n\n- User\n- Scenarios\n- User map\n- UX Style Guide\n\n### 4. Source code documentation\n\nIt is clear that good code does not need documentation, but it is also clear that as programmers we have different styles and approaches to create solutions, and this diversity needs a common framework to understand each other clearly: code documentation.\n\n**Model**\n\n- General frameworks\n- Commented code\n- Data binding types\n- Design and creation pattern\n- Security measures\n- Additional\n\n### 5. Process document\n\nThis document should chronologically detail the work plan, the responsible parties, their deadlines and the expectations of the entire development. Process documentation will promote communication and transparency among members and departments involved.\n\n**Model**\n\n- Plans, estimates and schedules\n- Reports\n- Working documents and manuals\n- Objectives and best practices\n\n### 6. Quality documentation\n\nThe objective behind this documentation is to address, monitor and execute the developments and tests necessary to control and guarantee the quality of the technological product. These tests are usually very specific and each one corresponds to a certain objective within the operation or execution of the application.\n\n**Model**\n\n- Quality management plan\n- Test strategy\n- Test plan\n- Specification\n- Checklist\n\n### 7. End-user documentation\n\nThis documented stage is dedicated to dynamically explaining how the product created can solve the problem the end user needs to overcome in the shortest and simplest way possible.\n\n**Model**\n\n- Quick User Guide\n- Complete manual\n- Troubleshooting Guide\n- Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### 8. System administrator's document\n\nHere you need to detail essential aspects that determine the functionality and availability of the application. These typically cover product installation and product and peripheral updates so that the administrator can keep the application running and its users can use it smoothly.\n\n**Model**\n\n- Description of functionalities\n- Administration Guide\n- Troubleshooting\n- Checklist\n- Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\n\nIn summary, under the engineering framework, technical documentation addresses all types of documented information related to the development cycles that all software products go through. Therefore, tracking and monitoring is a valuable tool not only for the creation of documentation but also for the improvement of the quality of the software produced.\nIf you are looking for a flawless execution of the above, you need to have a great professional team, in our case, we have experienced professionals in the construction of both software and the documentation it requires in order to deliver to all our customers business tools of high value and business impact.

Pre-design\n\nIn this initial stage is where **the application market is studied, its audience is analyzed and also what is known as benchmarks** or reference studies are executed in case there are similar applications in order to gather accurate information to turn it into a _'brief'_, which is essentially the roadmap that allows moving in the right direction to develop the right application.\n\n## 2. Design\n\nOnce the strategic approach and its tactical execution have been established, it is time to design the application that will provide a solution to the brief.\nRoughly speaking, **at this stage the interface design (UI) and user experience [(UX)](https://www.dreamcodesoft.com/en/blog/ui-ux-crucial-components-for-development-high-value-web-applications) of the future application will be structured** and the process is iterated until the requirements are met.\nThis will result in a finalized visual design and UX flow that will allow **creating a functional prototype that can be tested among some users** or _testers_ giving shape to a final model that can be built by the developers.\n\n## 3. Development\n\nIn simple terms, this is where the application is built and released, according to our methodology, this process is done in development _sprints_ to create certain functionalities of the application.\nAt the end of each sprint a compilation of the code is done with the purpose of checking the fulfillment of the objectives internally and thus be able to deliver results in a granular and transparent way for the customer to check and approve from start to finish.\nTo finish this phase **some iterations are made in order to refine the final product and release the application** in app stores or websites where the client requires it.\n\n## 4. Support\n\nRegardless of the number of iterations and final adjustments that have been made **there is always the possibility that the application may fail in its release period** either due to external factors such as installation on old devices or outdated operating systems.\nTherefore, **it is of vital importance for clients to prepare for this type of inconvenience when making a budget calculation for their application** (normally between 15% and 20% is allocated). In this way they will have sufficient resources to deal with unexpected errors, handle eventualities that may arise, take advantage of new opportunities and plan for the growth of their application.\n\nAt DreamCode we are faithful to processes and we know how crucial it is for technological development that our teams of programmers know and implement the guidelines that each stage of development entails.\nAs a result, we have successfully participated in large projects throughout the continent and we have the experience and work methodology that your company needs to support you in your vision and in the search for better business opportunities through cutting-edge digital solutions.

That is the main reason why we have been motivated to expose in detail what is its current impact on the industry and what are the advantages and disadvantages of using JavaScript in the creation of applications of all levels.\n\n## A little bit of history\n\nJavaScript was originally created by Netscape with the specific requirement of solving the problems that the applications of the 90's and the delays of the fragile connections of the time produced in users' browsers. With this premise, the engineers at Netscape dedicated many hours of work in order to adapt several pre-existing technologies to develop a programming language executable in its own browser, that is, without the need of a compiler.\n\nThis is how the first version of JavaScript was produced, which was named LiveScript, and it achieved the purpose of optimizing the feedback in the interaction between visitors and sites.\n\nFor its next version, Netscape formed an alliance with Sun Microsystems and developed what we officially know as JavaScript, which was included in version 3.0 of its browser. Since this language was being implemented as an underlying technology by other browsers at the time, Netscape's management decided to standardize it to avoid a corporate war of technologies that would occupy another branch of development within its organization.\n\n## JS today\n\nAs Internet technologies evolved dynamically, the passing of time brought with it important improvements that extended the use of JavaScript to other environments not related to the web. This is how today its attributes are used by tools such as Adobe Acrobat, Flex and even Photoshop, the popular image editing software.\n\nIn addition, since version 6 of Java, a completely different programming language and alien to JS, includes a package (javax.script) which enables the integration of these two languages through an [API](https://www.dreamcodesoft.com/en/blog/API-driven-Architecture-simplifying-software-development) capable of creating scripts to improve the runtime performance of certain Java applications.\n\n## What can be done with JavaScript?\n\nCurrently, JavaScript is the only programming language natively integrated into web browsers, meaning that JS does not need to be compiled so that browser applications can directly read its code and execute its actions.\nSpecifically, it is a scripting language capable of integrating itself into HTML documents for the purpose of validating information and modifying the navigation of website visitors without the need to communicate with the server. This, on the one hand, significantly increases the dynamism and interactivity of websites for users _(FrontEnd Development)_ and, on the other hand, has a positive impact on saving time and resources with respect to the server _(BackEnd Development)_.\nNow, **what can JavaScript do in other environments, specifically in the context of applications?**\nIt is clear that JS is a great tool for developing web applications, so we will refer exclusively to **downloadable apps for iOS and Android platforms**.\n\nBroadly speaking and current JavaScript allows you to create two types of applications:\n\n## Hybrid apps\n\nThese are nothing more than those applications that need to have the browser integrated within its infrastructure in order to run. This is known as webview mode which is a navigation interface with no other option than the visualization of the pages of the hybrid app.\nTherefore these apps are created using all available web technologies (HTML + CSS + JS) and are executed as if they were web pages.\n\n## Native apps\n\nAs you might expect native applications do not run in webview mode, in other words these apps are not a conglomerate of web pages but are fully debugged and compiled applications, just like those developed with other contextual languages.\n\nSo, having clear the types of applications that we can create with JS and that thanks to certain runtime environments such as Node.js or AngularJS this language turns out to be a powerful development alternative capable of producing applications that meet market standards, it is time to point out its advantages and disadvantages in every sense.\n\n## Advantages of JS\n\nâ **Learning:** While JavaScript is not a programming language suitable for beginners, intermediate level developers can usually understand and master it in a few months.\n\nâ **Simplicity:** Compared to such a popular language as C++, writing code in JS is noticeably simpler because its syntax is Java-inspired.\n\nâ **Recognition:** On a digital level, JavaScript is everywhere so your users will have no problem when they require additional resources or support.\n\nâ **Interoperability:** JS can be implemented in all types of applications thanks to its support for other programming languages such as PHP.\n\nâ **Server load:** Its demand for server resources is low and, in some cases, null.\n\nâ **Robust interfaces:** FrontEnd development with JS provides better user interfaces (UI) and also enhances the user experience (UX).\n\nâ **XMLHttpRequest:** Designed by Microsoft in JS this object is invoked as an HTTP request which creates asynchrony on the server to send and receive data on both sides without reloading the pages.\n\nâ **Global acceptance:** Many of the most important companies in the world believe in this language, that is the case of Google and Facebook who created AngularJS and React.js respectively.\n\nâ **Versatility:** Thanks to Frameworks such as Node.js and ReactJS with JAvaScript it is possible to approach diverse projects from both FrontEnd and BackEnd development.\n\nâ **Performance:** By reducing the length of the JS source code, it improves performance in the delivery of websites and applications.\n\nâ **Extended functionality:** Thanks to plugins created by third party developers can integrate predefined code snippets to create applications more easily and quickly which translates into saving time and money.\n\n## Disadvantages of JS\n\nâ **Security:** Since all users are able to see the JS code of the sites, others can use it maliciously.\n\nâ **Compatibility:** JS code must be tested on many platforms before being published because some may not support its latest features.\n\nâ **Inheritance:** JavaScript does not support multiple inheritance, only single inheritance and this can be a problem in software that requires the object-oriented feature.\n\nâ **Fragility:** A single code error is capable of stopping the deployment of all JavaScript code on a web site.\n\nâ **Capacity:** Due to the deeply detailed work from a coding point of view creating very large applications with JavaScript can be very complex.\n\nâ **Resources:** In some cases there may be a situation where there is no support for the latest API and reverse engineering is needed to implement them.\n\nâ **Flexible nature:** This feature can be both an advantage and a disadvantage. Unfortunately we interpret it as a disadvantage because JavaScript is not very strict in enforcing its own rules and this can generate bad habits in developers who do not do a careful and neat job.\n\nJavaScript has stood the test of time and has gone much further transcending to other ecosystems if we evaluate it from its initial purpose. For that reason, today it has become an ultra-versatile and very powerful tool for the creation of adaptable software at all levels in the application environment.\nThat is why at DreamCode we specialize in offering comprehensive and cost-effective services through the right human talent for the creation of effective JavaScript solutions to increase the performance of our customers.

To this end, the members of the development team have the mission of integrating, in a shared repository and continuously, all changes or adjustments to the source code.\nThis allows testing and compilation at each insertion with the objective of discovering errors and resolving them quickly, **allowing the creation of a software creation lifecycle with automated tools** which reduce efforts and increase results.\n\n## Continuous Delivery (CD)\n\nThe purpose of this methodology is to **keep the code in a deployable state**. That is, its set of processes ensures that all configuration modifications, bug fixes and code updates can be released to a production phase without the need for manual checks.\nThe purpose of CD is to **enable development teams to release code in loops or short cycles** to build, test and deploy software to shorten its final delivery to production.\nGenerally speaking, CI establishes a lifecycle in which the effort to build software is reduced in order to test and integrate it, and CD creates loops where software is tested to verify its functionality in order to deliver the best quality solutions.\n\n## Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) features:\n\n1. Focuses on defining life cycles for the software.\n2. Relies on pre-programmed tools.\n3. Relies on process automation.\n\n## DevOps\n\n**More than a DevOps methodology,** it is a collaborative culture that focuses on ideas, technologies, processes and roles to streamline software production, making it more efficient and organized by sharing development processes and operations in a single framework. See our article to learn more about [DevOps](https://www.dreamcodesoft.com/en/blog/devops-the-recipe-of-success-software-development-for-companies).\nUnder automated infrastructure, DevOps teams develop software in small pieces in order to integrate, test, monitor and deploy it in short periods of daily work. This **allows an increase in the frequency of deployments and a reduction in software release time**.\nThe purpose of DevOps is to eliminate the negative impact of professional overspecialization and indirect roles within development teams to **ensure clean and effective software production**. This is because a DevOps team has no internal barriers between the engineering and operations areas as all team members are trained in the skills of each role, ensuring better communication, participation and collaboration on each project.\n\n## Characteristics of the DevOps culture:\n\n1. Focuses on a collaborative culture.\n2. It relies on team members.\n3. Depends on everyone's participation.\n\n## Agile\n\nBeing the precursor methodology of CI/CD and DevOps, Agile Development **recognizes as its main objective to deliver effective technology solutions** based on frequent and iterative cycles in which collective participation is encouraged under the framework of values and techniques of the Agile manifesto.\nIts set of processes **eliminates internal barriers within development teams and enables effective collaboration between key stakeholders** (developers and customers) to accelerate delivery. On the one hand, this is possible due to its short lifecycles that also include customer feedback and on the other hand because its teams are borderless in their composition, making its members highly cooperative, self-organized and cross-functional professionals.\nIn essence **Agile seeks to empower all members**, invite customers to be part of the team, adapt to change and reduce time to produce high quality software.\n\n## Features of Agile Development:\n\n1. Focuses on processes.\n2. It relies on all project members.\n3. Depends on your response to change.\n\n## General differences\n\n- **Agile** is a practical philosophy and framework within which DevOps and CI/CD exist.\n- **DevOps** is a group attitude and agile development methodology that uses tools to accelerate software production, testing and release.\n- **CI/CD** is a DevOps method for achieving agile development through technologies that automate your processes.\n\n## Recapitulating\n\nAll three practices share the same goal: Produce the best software solutions in the shortest possible time. So:\n\n- **Agile** allows you to manage workflows to develop software by relying on processes and human resource to listen and correspond to customer requests and changes.\n- **CI/CD** is an outgrowth of Agile but relies on process automation so as not to depend entirely on the human element. This allows testing almost from day one and with greater consistency to reduce costs and margin for error.\n- **DevOps** is an ideology that eliminates the structure based on the roles of its members, which allows you to achieve agile development through collaboration and communication between engineers and developers in all elements and stages of each project.\n\n## When is one software development methodology better than the others?\n\nOn a practical level **the only difference that exists between Agile, DevOps and CI/CD is related to the implementation of their processes**, this means that none is better than the other in terms of results because as mentioned above each of these practices is oriented to help teams develop high-value solutions in the shortest possible time.\nTherefore, engineers or developers implementing any of these practices should be aware of the others and **if they plan to move from one to another they should make sure that their teams and companies are prepared** for the change so as not to affect the customer experience.\nSo, in short it is worth keeping in mind that:\n\n- **Agile** focuses on processes that support change while accelerating delivery.\n- **CI/CD** focuses on software-defined lifecycles and relies on tools that promote automation.\n- **DevOps** focuses on group culture relying on all members and their participation.\n\nAt DreamCode we have agile methodologies that allow us to implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) processes in all the technological developments that our clients require.

Julia\n\nDesigned exclusively for producing numerical analysis and computational science software **Julia continues to gain popularity thanks to its agility, convenient syntax and great computational power**. Created in 2012, this is a relatively young language and is constantly expanding the number of its Machine Learning libraries thanks to its growing and highly participative support community.\n\nIts proven high performance in technical and scientific fields has allowed Julia to serve as a platform for developing AI in which its users highlight features such as:\n\n- Dictionaries and introspective code\n- Common numeric data types\n- Macro management and meta programming\n- Robust mathematical functions\n- Built-in package manager\n- Ability to work concurrently for parallel and distributed computing.\n- Support for C functions\n\nOverall **Julia is the most viable choice for developing AI applications that require high numerical computational power**. In addition, it is also friendly to novices who have Python skills and want to program AI solutions.\n\n## 2. Java\n\nThis is **one of the most widely used programming languages in the world for various purposes, artificial intelligence is undoubtedly one of them**. Among its greatest advantages are its powerful Virtual Machine Technology, which facilitates its implementation processes, and its multiplatform compatibility, which eliminates the need to rewrite code when using different systems.\nJava **has libraries and frameworks created specifically for AI** among which are:\n\n- OpenNLP\n- Deep Java Library\n- Kubeflow\n- Neuroph\n- Java Machine Learning Library\n\nJava is one of the most user-friendly languages and has a large number of opensource libraries making it a flexible language that offers simple code debugging, support for large-scale deployments and graphical representation of data.\nIn addition Java is quite popular in web and application development, thanks to the fact that most of **these frameworks are supported by artificial intelligence systems** choosing Java for AI development is the best choice we as programmers could make, currently **this language has positioned itself as one of the most popular choices for maintaining, moving securing and deploying robust artificial intelligence applications**.\n\n## 3. C++\n\nC++ is a very popular language among the developer community because it is one of the most flexible and current low-level languages available. This allows it to work well with hardware and machines making it an ideal language for managing artificial intelligence models.\nAlso, many of the machine learning libraries have been created with C and this is a great advantage when creating neural networks in a clearer way for machines.  \nAmong the advantages of C++ for the development of AI applications are:\n\n- Multiparadigm language\n- Object-oriented\n- Extensive library of functions\n- Ease of solving complex problems\n- Extensive collection of programming tools\n\nIn addition, C++ allows the use of extensive algorithms and is considerably effective in the use of statistical techniques for AI which puts it above other languages in this feature alone.\n\n## 4. R\n\nIf you want to program applications that require data analysis and representation, R is the best alternative we can advise you. This language is open source and **has been used to develop solutions in industries such as education, telecommunications, finance and health sciences** among others.\n\nAmong its features R comes with built-in functional programming, object-oriented structure and vector computation and **although it has few libraries for AI all are very advanced in both its utility and performance**.\nAmong these are:\n\n- RODBC\n- TM\n- OneR\n- gmodels\n\nR has integrated data and graph modeling support that allows developers to work on Deep Learning in a practical and agile way.\n\n## 5. Python\n\n**The most popular language among both novice and expert developers is also an ideal AI tool when creating code for Machine Learning and neural network connections**. Its modern syntax is also minimalist and flexible, which is why it has been implemented in web development as well as in DevOps, even so, its area of greatest influence and scope is artificial intelligence where it has managed to excel.\n\nFor this purpose, Python has frameworks exclusively for AI, among which the following stand out:\n\n- PyTorch\n- Keras\n- Scikit-learn\n- Theano\n\nIn any context **Python has managed to position itself thanks to the ease with which users find it easy to learn and deploy**. It also has a large community that offers support, library development and countless forums around its implementation.\n\nTo close it is important to make clear that **in the current context the adoption of artificial intelligence is imperative in companies seeking automation and digital transformation that gives the ability to create business solutions of maximum precision in the search for benefits** such as reduced operating costs, increased efficiency in its current market, penetration into new markets or development of business alternatives.\n\nFor all of the above **if your company is looking to accelerate growth or improve the delivery of products and/or services through an AI deployment focused on your business objectives, DreamCode offers you a consolidated team of technology specialists with the necessary experience to plan and execute the IT developments that dynamize your processes in favor of your digital competitiveness**.\nVisit our [website now](https://www.dreamcodesoft.com/en/about), get to know our work methodologies and make the right technological decision to overcome the challenges of business digitalization.\n"},{"id":1655874000,"title":"Lean Programming, a convenient software development practice inherited from the business world.","metaTitle":"Lean Programming, a convenient software development practice inherited from the business world","meta_description":"Understand what Lean Programming means and why it is so valuable in the technology industry.","read":"5 -10 min","date":"June 22, 2022","url":"lean-programming-a-convenient-software-development-practice-inherited-from-the-business-world","imglink":"lean-programming-a-convenient-software-development-practice-inherited-from-the-business-world.jpg","category":"innovation","content":"\nIn the field of software development, Lean Programming is the greatest expression of the concept of optimization, **its goal is to produce computer applications of the best quality in the iterations of each of its projects**. Even so, this methodology is often confused with Agile Development, which is why it remains hidden from much of the developer community, a timely reason to break it down in this article.\n\n## Origin of the Lean concept\n\n**The IT industry is one of the most evolutionary**, if not the most evolutionary, in the business world thanks to its perpetual quest for perfection in both its processes and its products. This is due to the enormous and reiterative effort of multidisciplinary teams of engineers and scientists who, supported by concepts from other fields, have managed to innovate and discover best practices to produce ever more impeccable technologies.\n\nThis is how the Lean Manufacturing concept, developed by Toyota to position itself as the most reliable and efficient automotive brand in the world, managed to **fit perfectly in the IT industry, giving rise to what we know as Lean Programming**.\n\n## What does Lean Programming mean in software development?\n\nIn broad terms, Lean Programming refers to **eliminating the unnecessary to produce high quality software**. This principle is shared by the popular Agile Development methodology and is often confused.\nDespite this, there are those who consider that the **Lean Programming methodology is much more precise and productive thanks to the convergence promoted by its precepts**, which are:\n\n**Waste elimination**\nAny aspect that does not generate or add value to customers will be considered redundant and will have to be immediately removed from the workflow\n**Quality construction**\nThe ultimate expression of quality in IT development is the satisfaction of customer needs.\n\n**Generate and promote knowledge**\nSince technologies are not inert, developers need to constantly educate themselves to make decisions based on facts and not on assumptions.\n\n**Dilate commitment**\nBefore taking an action or making a decision, the needs and requirements of customers must be internalized and deeply understood.\n\n**Work respectfully as a team**\nPremature deadlines or heavy workloads often lead to neglect of relationships between team members, which limits productivity.\n\n**Optimize everything**\nTo deliver maximum value, it is necessary to generate accurate and precise lines of code in a timely manner.\n\n**Quick delivery**\nExcessive planning, unresolved issues and over-engineered developments should be avoided at all costs.\n\nIn summary, Lean Programming **is an optimal work culture capable of producing high performance software** so this type of business methodologies should be considered when choosing a team to develop technology projects at a higher level.\n\nAt DreamCode we implement high-level precision methodologies that allow us to be efficient both in the delivery and in the resolution capacity of our technological developments.

To give an example, this is how we have reached the convenience of being able to access our Netflix account through our Google or Facebook user profiles, as well as being able to buy products on eBay and Amazon paying with our bank card thanks to PayPal or PayU.\n\nIn technical terms, an API is **the grouping of functions and protocols that establish the rules or parameters that allow the integration of products and services with others**. In practical terms, APIs are the **software pieces that enable multidirectional communication between applications** of different natures.\nMoreover, their use is so widespread that today there are APIs for proprietary use by companies and/or partners or public APIs with and without usage limitations, among others. This is how **programmers can interconnect specific third-party services such as payment systems or registration systems with their applications without having to create them themselves**.\n\nTo better abstract the API concept and its applicability, let's suppose we are planning a trip, specifically at the moment of booking flight tickets, let's remember that our grandparents and parents used to do this in person or by phone, but now there are better ways to do it and all of them are virtual.\n\nThen, choosing any means of reservation we will be able to see the free seats and those already taken, and this information must be universal or else the potential chaos would collapse all the channels of attention, even the face-to-face ones.\nNow, taking into account that there are face-to-face, telephone and digital means to buy our flight tickets, how do offices, travel agencies, virtual advisors and booking applications manage to have the same information about the available offer in real time?\n\nIf you thought of an API then we have managed to make clear the concept and its **determining advantage when doing business**, since the sales channels have become heterogeneous in order to reach all customers, that is why they cannot run the same software. What is possible is to **feed from the same information through the implementation of a standardized API able to nurture and be nurtured from each platform or point of sale**, thus democratizing the supply of products and services for any type of customer while increasing the profitability and profits of companies.\n\n## What are the main types of APIs?\n\nMoving on to a more technical and detailed explanation of APIs, there are four main types of APIs:\n\n**Open APIs**\nAlso known as public APIs, these have a relatively low level of restrictions so that most of their systems are completely transparent allowing a quick implementation **in all companies that need to improve communication with users and third parties.**\n\n**Partner APIs**\nThis type of API is very similar to open APIs in terms of its ability to establish communication between companies and their partners and external users, the difference is that in this type of **API a layer of security is added by creating individual credentials (KEYS)** for registration and access of participants.\n\n**Internal APIs**\nThese types of APIs are also known as private APIs because they exist solely to facilitate activities such as information exchange between departments that optimize business operations. Like partner APIs they also **grant access via keys but add another layer of security** by checking the identity of users.\n\n**Composite APIs**\nThis type of API integrates within itself other data or service APIs to provide an all-in-one solution (microservices) that through the synchronous execution of a sequence of tasks **boosts the performance of execution processes and the performance of service channels**.\n\n**API protocols (Web Service APIs)**.\nFundamentally, a Web Service is an API created exclusively to establish a multidirectional web communication channel. It is therefore said that **\"all Web Services are APIs but not all APIs are Web Services \"**.\nHere are the most common types:\n\n**SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)**.\nThis Web Service API **uses XML as a predefined format for data transfer** and is therefore quite robust and capable of solving any communication need.\n\n**REST (Representational State Transfer)**\nBecause this protocol is a **set of structural rules that define how data should be created, read, updated and deleted** it is very useful when interactions are simple or resources are limited.\n\n**XML-RPC**\nThis protocol **uses a specific XML format to transfer information which makes it quite simple and practical** as it requires reduced bandwidth for communication.\n\n**JSON-RPC**\nVery similar to XML-RPC this standard is quite simple and practical, **using JSON text format instead of XML** to achieve a much lighter and faster data transfer.\n\nThis is how **APIs manage to enrich the user experience through better service access structures as well as the creation of new functionalities** that solve problems that remain unknown until now. This is the main reason why leading companies in the industry continue to design and implement APIs as a key element of innovation both for their customers and for their new business avenues.\n\n## Uses and advantages of an API\n\nBasically, APIs are able to optimize many processes because they can generate the triggering or deployment of sets of actions one after the other.\nTo summarize, **let's review in which areas the implementation of an API has managed to improve the cadence and results of certain processes**:\n\n- Payment gateway integration\n- Data recording and updating\n- Accounting and annotations\n- Marketing and advertising\n- Invoicing and balancing\n- Data Analytics\n\nLikewise, APIs can be implemented anywhere where opportunity arises, it is known that several of the benefits they provide when integrating software are improvements in:\n\n**Data volume:** By making processes independent, only the strictly necessary information is used.\n\n**Global security:** APIs atomize the systems by making their use independent, which allows maintaining the security of the entire platform.\n\n**Agility in systems and applications:** By avoiding the activation of all system processes in certain interactions, everything is faster.\n\n**Cost reduction:** Both implementation and maintenance costs.\n\n**Process automation:** Savings in effort, time and money within DevOps teams.\n\n**Innovation:** APIs restructure and organize the internal systems of companies to generate new ways of offering services or directly offer new services.\n\nOutside the list, **another benefit of APIs is that their use is not exclusively limited to large companies; they can bring innovation to any business that seeks to create accessible solutions for its customers**. In addition, in the case of developers, they allow easy integration for their use, resulting in the gain of new competitive advantages according to their functionalities.\n\nIn general, **the integration of a third-party API is a fairly simple and quick task depending on the documentation provided by its own developers**. This means that the first step for the correct implementation of certain APIs is to judiciously review such material.\n\nIn general, **the integration of a third-party API is a fairly simple and quick task depending on the documentation provided by its own developers**.

In fact, **they are positioning themselves as standards in IT, design and other industries** and therefore it is imperative for both designers and programmers to adopt their precepts in each of their roles.\n\n**Let's start with the basics:**\n\n## What is UI?\n\nIn essence **User Interface or User Interface (UI)** is the structural configuration that outlines how users interact with digital products or services. It is responsible for **delivering both immersive and intuitive solutions capable of assertively conveying business value**.\n\nFor that purpose the User Interface design seeks a balanced relationship between objects according to their:\n\n- Hierarchy\n- Consistency\n- Storytelling\n- Personalization\n- Relevance\n\n## What is UX?\n\nIn practice, **User Experience or User Experience (UX)** is the feeling, the degree of satisfaction or **the opinion that is generated in us after interacting** with websites, applications, products, services or brands among others. In short, it is the design and development focused on the human side.\nAmong the parameters necessary for the User Experience to generate recall, are:\n\n- _Look and feel_ (Visual Impact)\n- Credibility\n- Accessibility\n- Usability\n- Navigability\n\n## How are UI and UX integrated in the roles of programming and application design?\n\nTaking into account that the creation of applications and websites is a multidisciplinary activity which involves mainly design and IT development professionals, we will explain below how their roles intervene in this process:\n\n## Design:\n\n- **UI:** UI designers are in charge of the technical task of **developing the sketches and prototypes of the final product** and refining its visual and interactive aspect until it is finalized, relying on the iterative UX design guidelines throughout the process.\n\n- **UX:** The responsibility of a UX designer lies in **evaluating and testing UI designs in order to improve them** by creating tuning parameters according to user behavior.\n  These positions are so closely related that it is quite common to find designers who are both UI and UX experts at the same time.\n\n## Programming:\n\n- **Frontend:** Through various programming languages the frontend is in charge of developing the approved user interface, in other words it implements what the UI designer has previously created.\n\n- **Backend:** A backend developer is in charge of developing the internal structure and the connection with servers and databases that the application needs to operate.\n\nHere it is also very common to find developers who are experts in frontend and backend, which are called _FullStack_.\nNow that you know the guidelines that govern UI and UX design and understand how the various professional teams interact with each other in the design and development of applications, we hope you can count on us to support your next business decisions.\n\nIf your business need to make a new technological deployment and you are looking for high level consulting in app development, web sites, software architecture, databases or to include specialized professionals in your development

now you are already familiar with words like **Bitcoin, Blockchain, digital economy, financial developments, cryptoassets, cryptocurrencies, cryptocurrencies, decentralization**, etc.\n\nAnd it is not for less since **due to the pandemic caused by Covid-19, we have witnessed an extreme digital transformation** that has led IT and its innovations to position itself as a fundamental pillar, if not the main one, of our society.\n\nAs a result of this technological boom, which has been transversal to all human activities, **a new milestone has been generated as far as economy and finance are concerned**: Cryptoassets and the software developments around these.\n\nBefore continuing, it should be clarified that **the cryptocurrency market was already quite popular before the pandemic**, but it was because of this global crisis that propelled its growth by 300% in 2020, according to Statista.\n\nAlthough **there are still quite a few grey areas and gaps regarding the adoption of cryptocurrencies**, we want to dig, for practical purposes, into the essential aspects of this emerging market in order to understand the new IT approaches and challenges that fintechs have and what their role is in the transformation of the business world.\n\n## Blockchain, transparency and democracy made technology.\n\nLeaving history and its protagonists aside, **the foundation on which cryptocurrencies and platforms around them are based is called Blockchain**.\n\nThe blockchain is a technological solution capable of link and secure series of electronic data, which must be previously validated by several sources, and then chained by cryptographic sequences ordered in time. **Just like adding links to a chain and numbering, taking note of the instant of time at which each one is added**.\n\nThus, the structured way in which data blocks are created in this data system, along with the cryptographic identifier or hash, also known as fingerprint or digital signature, are **the key properties that keep the data in the chain protected against manipulation or alteration**.\n\nIn detail, **to add new transactions or blocks to the chain, there must be a verification consensus among all the members or nodes** (anonymous computers completely unknown to each other) that are active within the network.\n\nThe new block is then compared with each of the existing copies of the chain, and if the necessary conditions are met, it is approved and designated as the last link in the chain. And this democratic participation of the network members that avoids centralization or the need for a validating entity as an intermediary in the process.\n\nAs a result, all the blocks belong to the public domain and are available for consultation and review, as if they were a ledger or master book open to all. Moreover, these records canât be modified or deleted thanks to its digital signature and this is what makes any development in the blockchain a transparent and democratic creation by derivation.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, this technology could generate important advances in the financial world. The adoption of the Blockchain, given its decentralized and highly reliable character, would promote development, inclusion and innovation in financial circuits. A compelling reason to keep an eye on this promising technology.\n\n## The first wave: Bitcoin (BTC)\n\nBitcoin is the quintessential cryptocurrency, it is the definitive and irrefutable argument that it is possible to perform peer-to-peer (P2P) monetary transactions without intermediaries, using blockchain technology as a support.\n\n## How did it originate?\n\nIn 2008, under the pseudonym of Satoshi Nakamoto, a completely unknown man at the time and today, published a whitepaper in which he detailed in depth a P2P payment system using a digital currency called \"Bitcoin\".\n\nMonths later, this same man registered the first block of this currency, thus giving rise to the first blockchain network and the world's first cryptocurrency, the Bitcoin.\n\n## How are new bitcoins generated?\n\nAccording to our global structure, each country has its own form of government and in turn they have their own monetary system which is responsible for regulating the amount of fiat money in circulation. This printed money is what allows us to acquire goods and services as we need after having received it in exchange for selling goods or providing a service within society.\n\nWith bitcoin the situation is fundamentally different and that is what makes it revolutionary, because although it is a (crypto) currency with which we can acquire goods and services, it **is not part of the monetary system of any government and therefore cannot be issued or controlled by any of them**, thanks to the decentralization of the blockchain.\n\nTherefore, **in order to create new bitcoins, a digital process known as mining** is applied, in which network participants solve highly complex mathematical calculations to obtain new coins of the cryptocurrency in exchange. And although it sounds simple, it is not since it requires very powerful machines technologically speaking as well as **a condition of participation called proof of work (POW) which avoids the falsification of the tran by requiring the unanimous approval of all active nodes in the network**.\n\n## The second wave: Ethereum (ETH) smart contracts and dApps.\n\nVitalik Buterin is the mastermind behind the world's most important blockchain platform after bitcoin, Ethereum. This young Russian-born developer and writer, **once a member of the bitcoin community, proposed to use the network to generate and manage various collaborative and decentralized applications (dApps)** but his requests were unsuccessful.\n\nHe then formed a team of developers to launch his projects and in 2015 they gave life to Ethereum, **a digital platform of blockchain technology along with its own cryptocurrency known as Ether**.\n\nVitalik along with his team and his platform launched one of the most attractive functionalities within Ethereum, Smart Contracts. **These are, as he had dreamed for bitcoin, a collaborative solution which allows to create traditional contracts but written in computer language under predefined requirements that execute it**.\n\nIn simpler terms, a traditional contract, for example a purchase and sale contract, requires a third party to validate and execute it once the parties have agreed upon. **A smart contract is programmed in conjunction by the parties and is automatically executed once the stipulated conditions are met**.\n\n**Ethereum has positioned itself as the most promising blockchain-based platform for the business world due to its ability to provide significant value** in sectors such as real estate thanks to its transparency, efficiency and low cost. According to the consulting firm Deloitte.\n\n## The third wave: Tailor-made blockchain developments\n\n**The blockchain is a technology that is still under development and its uses and applications are still being discovered due to the potential seen by the private sector**, which is gradually taking part on this transformation of the economy.\n\nThis has triggered business initiatives, especially in the hotel sector, **which ones are basing their operations on platforms such as Ethereum to create their own currency (token)** and thus be able to give it value, utility or access capacity within their ecosystem.\n\nSimilarly, **financial companies such as R3 and JP Morgan have developed new types of blockchain applications to limit the use of public networks** by being able to create their own networks in situations that require a high level of trust in all participants to process their private transactions.\n\nFor this reason, the consulting firm **Gartner predicts that by the end of this year around 25% of global companies will have said yes to the adoption of Smart Contracts within their operations**.\n\nIn conclusion, **this technology, although disruptive, is still very young and has a long way to go before becoming the new business trend**. Although we must not forget that these platforms are evolving by leaps and bounds and **it could be a strategic mistake for companies and their CIO's to leave them off their radars**.\n\nFrom DreamCode **we understand the great challenge that means for many companies the adoption of new processes, yet it is imperative to be at the vanguard of the technological transformation we are living**. For this reason, we provide consulting services and guidance focused on the integration of business technology tools in order to increase the level of competitiveness that has very high standards today.\n\nOur developments have allowed several companies in the continent to optimize many of their processes.

But that complexity is not a limitation, and it shouldn't be, since **within that great mass of data lies insights that can become a high-value asset for business.**\n\nBig Data is a new paradigm which demands new tools for data analysis because its goal is not to possess a large amount of information, because this is growing exponentially every day, but rather **what companies can extract from the raw data.**\n\n## How is this data generated?\n\nTo put Big Data as a concept in context, let's think about the information we generate on a daily basis, that is, from the moment we wake up until we go back to bed. Probably the first thing we do is check our mobile, open our mail, check our social networks, news portals, entertainment apps, traffic, etc. **This is repeated on our way to work, in our offices, back home and so on**.\n\nThis interactive behavior generates footprints or traces that are printed and stored in the applications we have on our computers, which have **capture systems and infrastructures for storing raw data** that allow them to obtain information at all times, whether we are traveling or resting.\n\nA clear example of Big Data applied to our daily lives are mobility apps, such as Google Maps, Waze and Moovit, among others. Thanks to capturing and processing of data from other users, they are able to give us very accurate information in real time (arrival time, traffic alerts, alternative routes, etc.) about our trips from start to finish.\n\n## Which are its advantages?\n\nCurrently **there is a very high demand for scientific, technical and professional staff for the development of new analytical tools due to the great potential that big data has** in virtually all human fields as long as we continue to use electronic devices in our daily lives.\n\nSo we can say that **its advantages could be infinite** but we will state the most common ones so far. Companies that implement Big Data analytics have achieved:\n\n- Reduction of costs and operating times.\n- Optimization of processes and development of new products.\n- Better decision making.\n- Improved offerings to their customers.\n- Increased operational security\n- Refined knowledge about your audience and their preferences.\n\n## In what scenarios can Big Data be applied?\n\nIf you are considering the idea of adopting this practice, **it is quite natural to think that you can do so in diverse and multidisciplinary processes** such as marketing, production, decision making, research, etc.\n\n## Here are the 5 most relevant applications of Big Data:\n\n1. Business and finance optimization.\n2. Best practices in performance for the sports world\n3. Optimization of cities and metropolitan areas in terms of safety, traffic, public health, etc.\n4. Successful management of technology and resources.\n5. Transformation in science and research processes.\n\nIn summary, **Big Data is a source of information that needs to be processed accurately using the most appropriate technological tools for data extraction**, since its usefulness is focused on dictating new guidelines for business efforts. That is why **there is now a high demand for the development of high-precision tools that allow us to exploit this great resource** in the most effective way.\n\nAt DreamCode **we understand the importance of every decision that involves the development or adoption of new technological processes** that improve the operation or performance of your business.

To this end, we will enunciate its technological bases, what benefits it delivers, who are its leaders and how to take the first step to migrate to this new archetype of cloud computing for business development.\n\n## Reality VS Hype\n\nWhen it comes to web architecture, using the term _serverless_ is more pretentious than accurate. While it is clear that developers who opt for this technology will be able to forget about planning and configuring virtual machines, as well as not worrying about the task of managing and maintaining updated servers for their projects, this only happens because the responsibility will fall on someone else. In this case, companies dedicated to serverless computing.\n\nIn other words, thanks to this model, development teams will be able to dedicate all their efforts only to the functionality of their applications, leaving second and third order tasks in the hands of third parties, under the FaaS (Function as a Service) modality.\nIn this way, a website or application with serverless architecture can use a specific provider to validate user access, another to reproduce content according to the interaction and another to capture data from new visitors. Leaving to the determination of the providers the efficient distribution of the resources of the virtual machines to satisfy the demand of the application.\n\nThus, serverless architecture has proposed a new paradigm for both developers and businesses thanks to the decoupling of the intrinsic responsibilities of the applications. This favors cost reduction and promotes the development of monolithic or monolithic\nthe development of monolithic systems or traditional structures of [microservices](https://www.dreamcodesoft.com/en/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-microservices) to simplify processes according to the IT needs of the business.\n\n## Consequences of serverless implementation\n\nBefore we talk about advantages and disadvantages we will describe, roughly speaking, how a deployment under this infrastructure operates:\nIn a serverless development certain functions are processed by others which are called wrappers, these in turn may instantiate one or more subroutines for the purpose of absorbing their input data and processing it to deliver the resulting data expected by the system.\nIn the process of including new functions for their serverless applications, it is imperative for programmers to create and load the necessary wrappers under the appropriate language, be it Java, Go, PowerShell, Node.js, C# F#, Python or Ruby among others, as these are completely indispensable for the processing of such functions. Thus the _environments_ are originated and these are invoked to be able to execute the demanded methods.\n\nThese environments and their functions are stored within the serverless infrastructure along with an API gateway that can process the requests and instantiate the appropriate ephemeral container(s) to deliver the service. As a final step, after satisfying the request, the (ephemeral) containers are programmatically destroyed.\n\nIn practical terms, when an application has no resources assigned to it, it is because it is not being demanded by any user and thanks to this state of _non-existence_ it does not generate operating costs.\nLet us now talk about the most outstanding advantages of the serverless architecture:\n\n**For businesses:**\n\n**The requests determine the costs (pay-per-use):**\nThe operating costs of the applications are directly proportional to the use or access of its users. In other words, only the resources consumed in each request handled by the provider will be billed.\n\n**Zero waste of resources (on-demand computing)**\nIn the past, or rather with traditional hosting offerings, the only way to be prepared for high traffic events was to adopt an \"over-provisioning\" strategy. Now, thanks to the elasticity of the serverless architecture, we have managed to put an end to this waste of resources.\n\n**For developers:**\n\n**Fewer (underlying) responsibilities:**\nBy leaving aside the peripheral tasks of application development, a _fast track_ can be opened to reach the highest level of service optimization.\n\n**Auto-scaling (elasticity):**\nIt is no longer necessary for programmers to spend time configuring auto-scaling structures proportional to demand. This is now the direct responsibility of the supplier who calls them elastic systems because of their dual scaling (up or down).\n\n**For users:**\n\n**High availability (intrinsic):**\nThe serverless infrastructure offers high availability by default, the necessary resources will always be available according to the demand of the visitors.\n\n**Individual storage (for the customer):**\nIt is highly probable that applications under serverless architecture allow their users to integrate their own storage backend such as Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, Dropbox, etc.\n\n## Does serverless architecture have disadvantages?\n\nApplications under this infrastructure have a very neat and debugged source code which allows them to be highly efficient in function and delivery. Even so, they must adapt to the power and work standards of the various cloud computing providers, since they implement the serverless scheme in their own way.\n\nWe can already talk about the disadvantages of this architecture:\n\n**For business:**\n\n**Lack of total control (dependence on third parties):**\nThe scope and availability for this type of applications will always be in the hands of its providers.\n\n**Resilience to security breaches (Incident management):**\nThe risk of an (indirect) cyber-attack that puts a serverless application out of service is higher because the attackers will aim at damaging the provider's networks. Again, it is up to the provider to overcome the eventuality and reactivate the operation as soon as possible.\n\n**For developers**\n\n**Best practice development guide (vendor-independent):**\nServerless technology is in a state of immaturity which has fragmented its interpretation. This results in each vendor developing its own concept of the service, making a global implementation difficult in many ways.\n\n**Limited local testing (variable complexity):**\nDifficulty in testing and verification increases due to dependence on third party configuration.\n\n**For users:**\n**High latency risk (from application design):**\nIf an application does not have a good structural design it will cause delays in service delivery to its customers.\n\n**Heterogeneous operation (service uniformity):**\nIt is very common for applications based on serverless architecture to have more than one provider for their deployment and this segmentation can cause the overall performance to fluctuate.\n\nIn summary, serverless architecture allows the creation of both flexible and lightweight applications, shortening the time to market for new products, reducing operating costs according to traffic peaks, as well as saving resources by sectioning their operation. On the other hand, its disadvantages lie in the immaturity of the technology itself and the existence of processes that cannot yet be relegated to vendors due to the size of their functions.\n\n## Market alternatives for serverless computing deployment\n\nServerless architecture allows programmers to abstract the underlying infrastructure but does not remove it from the workflow, which is why some companies offer FaaS (functions as a service) packages through which they store and run their customers' applications.\nCurrently, these are the most predominant serverless service providers in the market:\n\n**AWS Lambda (Amazon):** \"AWS Lambda is a serverless, event-driven computing service that lets you run code for virtually any type of application or backend service without provisioning or managing servers. You can power Lambda from more than 200 AWS services and software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications, and you only pay for what you use.\"\n\n**Azure Functions (Microsoft):** \"Develop more efficiently with a serverless, event-driven computing platform that helps solve complex orchestration problems. Build and debug locally without additional configuration, deploy and operate at scale in the cloud, and integrate services via triggers and bindings.\"\n\n**Cloud Functions (Google):** \"Cloud Functions lets you treat all Google and third-party cloud services as blocks. Connect and extend them with code, and quickly go from concept to production with end-to-end solutions and complex workflows. Plus, employ third-party services that provide webhook integrations to quickly extend your app with powerful features.\"\n\nAs mentioned above, since this is a young technology, it is up to each provider to decide the best concept of serverless architecture, so before opting for this service it is necessary to analyze introspectively and carefully which business functions can be adapted to the serverless model and thus be able to combine them with what the industry providers offer.\n\n## Migrating to serverless\n\nBefore taking the first step towards serverless architecture, the main thing is to understand the limitations of both the business and the technology itself. For example, in the case of a large application, it is mandatory to evaluate whether the current market options have the necessary processing capacity or whether it is better to continue with the traditional server model.\nOften companies with very robust applications gradually migrate, after analysis, certain components of their systems to keep the operation under control while adapting their services to reach the maximum level of release.\n\nIf you are looking for advice to take a step of precision when migrating your company's services to the cloud, it is time to contact us because we want to put at your disposal our experience in the development using AWS Lambda and Microsoft Azure in relationship with our agile work methodologies, which ones provide excellent results in a reiterative way.\nVisit us [here](https://www.dreamcodesoft.com/en/services) and let us advise you on the optimization of your digital processes so that together we can develop the ultimate technological solution that maximizes your business services.\n"},{"id":1646283600,"title":"Everything you need to know about microservices","metaTitle":"Microservices explained in detail, definition, benefits and uses","meta_description":"Understand microservices, what they are, how they work, how you can apply them in your business and what benefits they represent.","read":"5min","date":"March 3, 2022","url":"everything-you-need-to-know-about-microservices","imglink":"everything-you-need-to-know-about-microservices.jpg","category":"innovation","content":"\nMicroservices are being employed by more and more IT companies around the world thanks to the results they are providing in software development processes. To understand them in detail, we must first begin by understanding what they are and what the term \"Microservices\" refers to. The word \"micro\" in microservices means small applications. However, while they are independent, these applications are not always simple, as they must be as large as necessary to operate correctly or solve a particular problem. According to Microsoft, \"Microservices should be designed around business capabilities, not horizontal layers such as data access or messaging.\" Microservices communicate with other microservices and external users through APIs to create a broader application.\n\nApplications that are built based on microservices are composed of small, independent modules that communicate with each other through clear and defined pathways. Each microservice is focused on a single concept and its operation is refined and then merged with the others to generate a reliable, agile and adaptable end product.\n\n## The evolution of development architecture\n\nPreviously, in the era of IBM mainframe computers and the market dominance of Microsoft Windows operating systems, corporate IT environments used monolithic architecture as the development model for their applications. This is governed by the use of a structure in which all functional aspects of the software are coupled into a single program, always seeking the maximum degree of cohesiveness between modules on a single server. This ensured a good performance of the final product, but made the subsequent processes of maintenance, adaptability and extensibility of the applications very limited.\n\nFaced with the need for more agile, scalable and modifiable products, this architecture gradually evolved towards microservices. This change in the way of developing products was initially born in the open-source communities and from there external developers and emerging companies began to adopt this approach in their projects and also began to contribute code to extend the basic functions of the most widely used web server platforms. Over time, large technology companies began to see the benefits of microservices architecture and eventually migrated to it. Today, most major IT companies publish their own microservices and contributions to open-source projects governed by industry-specific standards and teams from a market rich in solutions based on unique functionality. Microservices are based on the same principle of innovation that developers apply to open-source solutions for cloud applications.\n\n## Advantages of microservices\n\nThe main advantage of microservices lies in the moment when it is necessary to create new functionalities for software applications, where traditional and emerging companies can speed up the arrival of their updates to the market, as opposed to the large amount of time required for a monolithic architecture. Users who prefer web and mobile applications are the ones who notice and appreciate these types of changes the most.\n\nIt is the technologies that respond first to change that will receive the best adoption by users and customers. Small and medium-sized businesses as well as large IT companies are finding advantages in staying on the cutting edge of programming and development by integrating new microservices.\n\nOptimized data automation: developers prefer to use platform-specific or standards-based tools in their work, including the use of programming languages and databases in web applications or mobile microservices. Microservices are tied to retail-structured processes, such as APIs, which can provide higher levels of data automation.\n\nTeam agility: Because each microservice is focused on delivering functionality related to a single business domain, teams assigned to a microservice lifecycle can work in parallel without \"stepping on each other's toes\". Each team can go at its own pace and deploy new functionality without depending on the others.\n\nScalable, market-ready applications: With shorter development cycles, microservices architecture enables faster deployment and upgrades. In addition, as demand for certain services grows, they can be deployed across multiple servers and infrastructures to meet needs.\n\nMinimize failures: If these independent services are well designed, they cannot affect each other. This means that if one part fails, it does not affect the entire application, unlike the monolithic model.\n\nAccessibility: As large applications are produced in small pieces, developers can understand, update and improve these pieces more easily, which helps speed up development cycles, especially when combined with [agile development methodologies](https://www.dreamcodesoft.com/en/blog/how-scrum-transformed-it-industry).\n\n## How do microservices work?\n\nMicroservices allow functions to be executed separately and, should one service fail, the rest will continue to function without being affected by this individual failure. In this sense, the operation of microservices consists of increasing the functionality available with respect to that offered by default by the management platform, the network or the data center.\n\nMicroservices-based solutions compete primarily with the service-oriented architecture (SOA) provided by Microsoft, Oracle, IBM and other large industry players focused on closed source distribution. Large enterprises must now support multiple applications written in PHP, Python, Ruby-on-Rails, Java, C++, ASP.net, etc. together or simultaneously in production environments.\n\nIn this manner, a data center can have multiple functional database frameworks across virtual machines on multiple client hardware. A web server must be configured to support custom extensions to stream multimedia content, API integrations or the addition of proprietary utilities reserved for analytics techniques. The combination of all these third-party and open-source services means thousands of microservices on a typical web server in a production environment, which must be multiplied by the millions of scalable virtual machines in a cloud services and public access environment.\n\n## Microservices Design Patterns\n\nRegardless of the language used to develop microservices, employing this methodology involves tackling problems that other developers have encountered before. Design patterns are formal, abstract solutions to recurring problems in the application development process, and several of them are specific to microservices. According to Devopedia, the most common patterns are:\n\n_Service Registry:_ to connect clients to available instances of microservices.\n\n_Circuit Breaker:_ to prevent failed services from being called continuously\n\n_Fallback:_ to provide an alternative to a failed service\n\n_Sidecar:_ to provide an ancillary service to the main container, such as for registration, service synchronization or supervision\n\n_Adapter:_ to standardize or normalize the interface between the main container and the external environment\n\n_Ambassador:_ to connect the main container to the external environment, such as for proxies from localhost connections to external connections\n\n## How to use microservices in my projects?\n\nExperts agree that approaching the complexity of microservices from scratch can be risky, however, they recommend employing them gradually and gradually. IBM has published its guide to the 5 key types of decisions an organization needs to make before embracing a microservices architecture:\n\n1. Business decisions\n\nCompared to the traditional monolithic approach, a mixed services strategy involves investments in finance, corporate culture and new developments and operations (such as [DevOps](https://www.dreamcodesoft.com/en/blog/devops-the-recipe-of-success-software-development-for-companies).\n\n2. Architecture and design decisions\n\nMicroservices introduce new architecture and design approaches and considerations; you must ensure that you are using the most appropriate architecture approaches and making the necessary application design decisions that will help you achieve your business objectives.\n\n3. Implementation Decisions\n\nConsider the various implementation options required for a microservices architecture, including platforms, frameworks, and programming languages.\n\n4. Culture Decisions\n\nIn order to create a microservices architecture, it is necessary to take into account the tolerance to complex processes such as the required high availability, unforeseen errors, disaster recovery, isolation of equipment, etc.\n\n5. Operational decisions\n\nFinally, make sure that your team can oversee and manage the microservices ecosystem, as it requires a deployment of both human and technological resources commensurate with a methodology that is characterized by its number of coupled parts.\n\nAt DreamCode, we have over 8 years of experience implementing microservices development architecture in conjunction with agile methodologies such as DevOps and Agile SCRUM.

This set of practices is supported by development and operations teams working together in an agile manner, commonly applying a [DevOps approach](https://www.dreamcodesoft.com/en/blog/devops-the-recipe-of-success-software-development-for-companies).\n\nContinuous Integration / Continuous Delivery was born aligned with the objective of today's application design: that developers can work simultaneously on different functions of the same application. As you well know, if a project merges all the diversified source code or tries to integrate different modules without having a clear process to do so, the processes can become tedious, slow and exhausting. For example, if a developer working for the team in isolation implements a change in an application, there is a high possibility that this change will conflict with modifications that other developers implemented simultaneously. This represents a commonly untraceable and potentially fatal flaw in development. The problem can be further exacerbated if each developer on the team works in their own local integrated development environment (IDE) and common cloud environments are not available.\n\nIn this scenario, the Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery set of practices represents one of the best decisions development teams can make. It is also an agile methodology best practice, as it allows software development teams to focus on meeting business requirements, code quality and security, all this thanks to automation in the deployment phases. Today we are going to analyze this set of practices in detail so that you can internalize the features, benefits and potential it represents. Applying these principles and methodologies to your application development processes will prove very beneficial to your business projects and keep quality standards at the highest level.\n\n## What is Continuous Integration?\n\nContinuous integration (CI) is a coding culture and set of best practices that drive development teams to implement small changes on an ongoing basis and to register code in repositories open to the team where different versions of the application are version controlled. As most cutting-edge software requires code built on different platforms and tools, modern teams need this mechanism to integrate and validate particular changes together.\n\nContinuous Integration (CI) allows developers to incorporate code changes into a shared repository, which is populated with updates periodically or even on a daily basis. Once a developer's changes are incorporated, they are validated by automatic compilation within the application and by running various automated tests to ensure that the changes are aligned to the overall project code and do not represent a failure for the project. By using Continuous Integration, we are monitoring the total of the environments that influence the development, from classes and general operation to the operation of the different modules that together give the functionality to the application in general. In case an automatic test detects a conflict between the new code and the current code, Continuous Integration is the lifeline that detects and facilitates the resolution of these errors quickly.\n\n## What is Continuous Delivery?\n\nWhen the automation of builds and Continuous Integration unit and integration testing is complete, Continuous Delivery enters the equation and is responsible for automating the movement of validated code into the repository. As you can see, this means that the effectiveness of Continuous Delivery is directly dependent on Continuous Integration being built into the development process beforehand. The goal of Continuous Delivery (CD) is to have a tested code base that can be deployed to the production environment at any time and stage of development. Each stage of this process, from the input of changes to the code to the distribution of builds in the repository ready for production, requires test automation and code release. At the end of this process, the project team has everything ready to send the application to production and has the guarantee that its implementation will be simple and fast.\n\nThe Continuous Delivery (CD) process requires a code base that can be deployed at any time to function properly. By employing Continuous Delivery, releases of new changes occur frequently and routinely without affecting the development teams, who in their daily tasks and routines of working on the project can have the confidence of sending a quality release to production at any time and without the need to follow extra steps that delay delivery times.\n\nContinuous Delivery allows developers to automate UI testing, load testing, integration testing, API reliability testing, and so on. This mechanism thus allows updates to be validated more thoroughly and problems to be discovered in advance. Being cloud-based, these tests are simple and cost-effective to automate, something that in the past was complex and costly to perform in physical environments and with limited resources.\n\n## Benefits of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery\n\n**Continuous Integration**\n\n1. Improved Code Quality\n\nContinuous integration is directly responsible for minimizing system failures due to code errors. Its proper use results in more robust code, which ensures software quality.\n\n2.  Easy and fast error detection\n\nBy integrating continuously and periodically, it is much easier to detect errors and prevent them from becoming a massive failure because they are resolved when they represent less risk. Continuous integration works as an agile security barrier.\n\n3.  Reduction of repetitive and/or manual tasks\n\nManual and repetitive processes run counter to software development at the forefront of today's standards. In addition, using them increases the possibility of making more errors. By reducing them, the project benefits greatly in terms of security and confidence in the product.\n\n4. Creating test versions on demand\n\nWhen code is constantly being integrated, it is possible to release software at any stage of development, in case it is required to go back or review previous versions. This good practice adds even more security to the team.\n\n5.  It increases the macro visibility of the project\n\nBy employing CD, you have concrete information of the project progress as detailed metrics of the code quality. This allows making better decisions when making changes or modifications in real time and monitoring the performance of each of the versions according to adjustments.\n\n6.  All in all, greater security for the work team\n\nContinuous integration ensures tested and functional software at any time, which ultimately generates a calm work environment in which developers can be more productive as software advances are tested, automated and guaranteed. The days of waiting until the end of the project to verify the correct functionality of the software are long gone.\n\n**Continuous delivery**\n\n1. Automating the software release process\n\nContinuous delivery allows the team to automatically create, test and prepare code changes for submission to production, improving the efficiency and speed of software delivery.\n\n2. Improved development productivity\n\nThese practices increase team productivity by freeing developers from manual tasks and encouraging behaviors that help reduce bugs and errors sent to customers.\n\n3. Timely bug fixes\n\nWith more frequent and detailed testing, your team can find and fix bugs before they become more serious problems. Continuous delivery makes it easier to perform other types of code testing because the entire process is automated.\n\n4.

Their popularity has grown tremendously in recent years, as these interfaces have facilitated software development throughout the IT industry. For example, when creating a new application, the developer does not have to start from scratch. All he has to do is get an API with the functionality he needs and adapt it to his needs.\n\nIn this sense, an API can be said to be a formal interface for specifying how a software module communicates or interacts with other modules to achieve one or more functions. It all depends on the application that uses it and the permissions that the API owner grants to external developers.\n\nAPIs can become complete toolkits. In this case, the application can send a request with a certain structure, and that structure will decide how the service or software to which the request is sent responds. Today we will explain why building a development architecture with these toolkits at the center of your strategy is the best decision for results-oriented companies and development teams.\n\n## What is API-driven architecture?\n\nAPI architecture refers to the process of developing a software interface that exposes backend data and application functionality for use in new applications. With an API-first architecture, you can create ecosystems of applications that are modular and reusable â which is ideal for microservices.\n\nBriefly, API-based architecture is the practice of designing and building the programming interface(s) and then starting the development of the application per se based on this environment and workflow model. Thus, this architecture is different from traditional development strategies.\n\nThe terms API-driven architecture, or API-first development, have been in use since about 2010, but it is only in the last couple of years that they have come into popular use in the IT sector as more and more software delivery teams have recognized the benefits it provides.\n\n## What are the benefits of implementing such an architecture?\n\n**1. Make everything accessible at any time and phase**\n\nIf you take a traditional approach to APIs, and design them after you have laid the groundwork for the rest of your application, it can be easy to overlook some components when deciding which parts of the application will communicate and benefit from them. For example, when it comes time to build the APIs, you may realize that one of your application's services formats data in a way that makes the submission process difficult, as a result, you find that redesigning that component to make it accessible through an API takes a lot of time, effort and resources, so you decide to fix it manually. As a result, you end up with accessibility gaps and increased delivery times.\n\nConversely, when you adopt APIs as the basis of your entire software architecture and delivery strategy, you put yourself in a position where it's easy to remember that every component of the application must be compatible and accessible via an API. As long as you employ this type of architecture, you are unlikely to encounter negative surprises that limit API support within your application.\n\n**2. Decoupling frontend and backend**\n\nOne of the most important advantages of an API-driven architecture is its ability to separate the frontend from the backend. This gives all team members the ability to eliminate any dependencies that may exist between the two ends. How does it work? Simple, thanks to APIs that allow each endpoint to communicate with the other by sending requests and getting responses in return. Those using API-driven architecture benefit from this process because they can use different technologies and tools when building either endpoint.\n\n**3. Modular CI/CD pipelines**\n\nNot only is the application architecture itself more modular and flexible under an API-driven development approach. The same benefits are potentiated if a continuous integration/continuous delivery [(CI/CD)](https://www.dreamcodesoft.com/en/blog/continuous-integration-and-continuous-delivery) is used to deliver the application using DevOps methodologies.\n\nWhen APIs are used to split the application into distinct modules, each module can be continuously delivered separately. As long as each part of the application and its place in the CI/CD pipeline remains compatible with the API interface and architecture you have defined, a problem in one module is unlikely to cause a delay in the rest of the pipeline. Each module can be updated separately, and at a different pace, while remaining compatible with other modules thanks to the API they share.\n\n**4. Cloud-optimized applications**\n\nAnother advantage of API-driven development, which is probably obvious to most developers, is that it results in applications that are \"natively\" cloud-ready, since they are built, first and foremost, for connectivity.\n\nAt this point, it is important to keep in mind that there are two different types of APIs: those that connect an application's internal services and those that connect the application to other cloud services. Having one type of API does not necessarily mean having the other. But when you adopt API-driven architecture, even if you start with creating internal APIs, you are helping to ensure that you think early on about all the APIs the application needs. This will, most likely, lead to an application that easily integrates with external applications and resources in the cloud.\n\n**5. Simplifies application complexity**\n\nAn API-driven architecture allows components and services connected to an API to remain modular. This means that components are independent and use the API to communicate and share information. It also means that API security testing can be easily performed to ensure that applications are free of vulnerabilities. Those who have implemented third-party APIs don't even have to learn all the underlying code that drives the API. All they have to do is implement it and remove it when they no longer need it. This demonstrates how an API-driven architecture reduces application complexity.\n\n**6. Reduced development time**\n\nWhen creating an application, developers don't have to write all the code on their own from scratch. They can implement an API and start from there. For example, if a developer wants to create an Uber-like application that uses maps, they can get the Google Maps API and implement it. This means they won't have to write that part of the code themselves. This greatly reduces development time and cost.\n\n**7. Avoid software obsolescence**.\n\nLast but not least, API-driven architecture is a useful strategy to avoid obsolescence of both your application and your APIs. Today, it is easy for an application to become obsolete because either its APIs are too difficult to modernize, or the application itself is difficult to integrate with modern API frameworks.\n\nAPI-driven architecture does not give a full guarantee that these things won't happen. If you don't keep your APIs up to date, your application may become obsolete. However, by keeping APIs front and center in the strategy, API-driven development will help prevent these eventualities.\n\n## How do we use API-driven Architecture at DreamCode?\n\nSmart organizations are using API-driven architecture to simplify their operations and meet the demands of their customers. In addition to reaping the benefits mentioned above, they are also able to meet the requirements of modern technology. This demonstrates the importance of API-driven architecture in the world of software development. This is why we at DreamCode adopt the use of this type of architecture as the basis of our entire development process.\n\nDo you have an application, IT project or digital transformation goal in mind?

Previously we talked about how fundamental it is [to have cloud services to remain relevant](https://www.dreamcodesoft.com/en/blog/types-of-cloud-applications-how-to-benefit-from-them), there we learned that more than an alternative, the cloud should be a priority and a necessity for businesses with long-term ambitions.\n\nToday we will tell you about the architecture that allows you to leverage cloud services and connectivity so that you can take full advantage of this must have and your organization can achieve its IT goals.\n\n## What is Cloud Native?\n\nThe term Cloud Native refers to a software development model in which applications are designed to be functional in the cloud from the beginning. The result of implementing this architecture is cloud-native software or NCA (Native Cloud Application), which can take full advantage of the benefits and capabilities offered by the cloud.\n\nCloud-native is a modern approach to building and running software applications that takes advantage of the flexibility, scalability, and resiliency of cloud computing. The term encompasses the various tools and techniques currently used by software developers to build applications for the public cloud, as opposed to traditional architectures that are tailored to an on-premises data center. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) defines Cloud Native by focusing on application integration, where applications are broken down into microservices and packaged in lightweight containers to be deployed and orchestrated across multiple servers.\n\n## The pillars of Cloud Native Architecture\n\nThis development model is based on pillars that complement and are independent of each other. To begin with, the microservices and technologies that have been custom-developed for the cloud environment must fulfill a unique and specific function that connects with all the essential elements to run correctly with the others. Secondly, the strategic aspect must be shaped by DevOps processes and the continuous delivery model. To design a well-functioning Cloud Native Architecture, both development and operations teams must be involved.\n\nQuality Cloud Native software is created in full collaboration between all teams involved. In this sense, to build an agile DevOps culture, the best solution for the end user must be thought of from the beginning: by fostering constant communication with the customer, the development team is adding certain features to a microservice, these, in turn, are automatically validated through continuous delivery processes.\n\nThe fundamental characteristic of the Cloud Native Software Development Architecture is precisely that it is conceived through these [microservices](https://www.dreamcodesoft.com/en/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-microservices), which are hardly linked to each other and are independent of each other as well as of the corresponding infrastructure. The key is that the communication between them is carried out through standardized [API](https://www.dreamcodesoft.com/en/blog/API-driven-Architecture-simplifying-software-development) interfaces that allow the end user to have the feeling of interacting with a single application. As a result, services are designed in such a way that they could be part of a completely different piece of software. The potential this allows is that microservices can be freely combined, copied and reused depending on the needs of the project.\n\n**Cloud Native Architecture at DreamCode**\n\nThe Cloud Native Architecture model is an active part of the software development process at DreamCode. We have seen firsthand its usefulness in process optimization, team integration and agility in the face of trends or changes that the market generate. Also, through previous projects all across America we have improved and refined its use.\n\nIf you want to know more about how we use the latest trends in software development enter [here](https://www.dreamcodesoft.com/en/contact).\n"},{"id":1644296400,"title":"What Agile testing is and how to apply its pillars","metaTitle":"What Agile Testing is and how software development projects benefit from its principles.","meta_description":"Learn how test automation can speed up software development without altering its quality","read":"3min","date":"February 8, 2022","url":"what-agile-testing-is-and-its-pillars","imglink":"what-agile-testing-is-and-its-pillars.jpg","category":"innovation","content":"\nSurely you have heard of agile software development, however, today you will learn what Agile Testing is, the winning card behind the optimization and agile culture in technology that is boosting the results of thousands of teams and companies around the world.\n\nThe term Agile Testing encompasses a series of product testing practices throughout its development. These practices are employed by each of the teams involved in the construction of the software, and it centers its operation on the role of a tester: a multifunctional expert who dominates and knows all aspects of the production line.\n\n## The Pillars of Agile Testing\n\nAt the core of Agile testing are the pillars that guide the team and keep it focused and productive in the face of constant and automated testing. These pillars function as the foundation of the agile development culture and, when well-integrated into the team, can be the catalyst for the success of the software development project. These pillars are:\n\n**Agile Testing saves valuable time**\n\nFollowing traditional methods, testing and testing occurs at the end of a development phase and if successful, the product is sent back to previous instances for adjustments. In contrast, using Agile Testing provides continuous feedback, allowing for real-time fixes during software development.\n\n**Everyone is a tester in the team**\n\nWhile the main tester role in each team is fundamental to guide the adjustments, in Agile Testing everyone involved in software development also runs tests in order to internalize the culture of constant testing.\n\n**The customer guides the iterations**\n\nThe basis of Agile Testing is feedback, both from each member of the teams involved and from the customer. It is the latter who is present in each iteration and provides his feedback, with which the adjustments have their north.\n\n**The code must be transparent**\n\nIn case of bugs, errors or adjustments that need to be made, the code should remain as clean as possible and new versions should be properly explained so that the whole team is on the same page.\n\n**Automation of Prevention**\n\nAs we said earlier, Agile Testing is based on the prevention of errors or bugs, as opposed to traditional methods that focus on finding and correcting them. Automating these tests and encouraging constant monitoring through internal software guarantees the maximization of resources.\n\nWe invite you to include these pillars at the center of your monitoring and testing strategies when approaching a software development project. Agile Testing may be the strategy you were looking for to bring out the full potential of your teams, while optimizing quality, delivery times and the satisfaction of your customers and their end users.\n\nIf you want to learn more about Agile Testing, test automation or how DreamCode implements these practices with clients all over the Americas, learn more about our software development methodology [here](https://www.dreamcodesoft.com/en/scrum).\n"},{"id":1641358800,"title":"Types of cloud applications, how to benefit from them.","metaTitle":"The main uses of the cloud for your organization, which are they and how to benefit from them.","meta_description":"The use of the cloud is expanding and demanding throughout the world's companies, but how to use it effectively?","read":"3min","date":"January 5, 2022","url":"types-of-cloud-applications-how-to-benefit-from-them","imglink":"types-of-applications-in-the-cloud.jpg","category":"innovation","content":"\nWith thousands of companies migrating their systems to the cloud, questions arise about the types of cloud applications and ways to use them. Previously we talked about its importance and why [your company should use it if it wants to stay relevant in the market](https://www.dreamcodesoft.com/en/blog/the-growing-need-for-cloud-systems), today you will learn the ways in which your company can use it to take full advantage of it.\n\nWe know that the main benefit of migrating information and apps to the cloud within a company is the easy and direct access to it. This information is available from anywhere in the world and employees have access to it 24/7 from any type of device, but what is the reason for the high performance of these applications? Undoubtedly the use of resources and the power provided by their providers without the consumption of resources by end users.\n\nAll the benefits of having applications in the cloud are summarized in cost reduction and efficiency for companies, by eliminating the high investment in the purchase, installation and maintenance of physical and hardware elements, an organization can increase its productivity and competitiveness in the market.\n\n## The main types of applications operated from the cloud\n\n- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): users can use resources from their hardware provider and thus benefit from the infrastructure provided by that provider. For example, remote access to specialized equipment, database servers, extra equipment that you do not have, etc.\n\n- Software as a Service (SaaS): the user benefits from the capabilities of the software itself. In this case, access to specific solutions is immediate and no software installation is required to access their functionalities.\n\n- Platform as a Service (IaaS): users can connect from a virtual platform and thus the user finally benefits from the capabilities of the software and hardware. This is a mix of the two previous ones, in which your team can remotely access a computer and benefit from all the systems installed on it.\n\nWhen the use of cloud applications within a company increases and is exploited to the fullest, the organization manages to be impacted within its culture and processes. However, the real challenge lies in ensuring that this impact can be positive and not negative, how is this possible? By directing all efforts and leadership to an agent specializing in infrastructure and cloud environments to evaluate, analyze and direct the migration according to the specific needs of each organization.\n\nAs you well know, the use of the cloud to host a company's applications has become mandatory. Market changes and transformation are driving managers and leaders of all types of companies to have all the information available, wherever they are, and virtual storage is positioning itself as the best option for information management and optimization.\n\nAt DreamCode, we are experts in cloud migration of all types of applications according to your company's needs.

Some time ago, we told you about [the importance of Agile SCRUM and how it revolutionized the IT industry](https://www.dreamcodesoft.com/en/blog/how-scrum-transformed-it-industry), today we want to delve a little into DevOps, a methodology as successful as SCRUM that you have to know.\n\nThe term DevOps comes from the combination of \"development\" and \"operations\" and as a methodology it defines the combination of people, processes and technology to deliver continuous value to customers. In this sense, the DevOps culture or methodology means that there are no isolated roles and, on the contrary, a value chain is built that integrates different areas (development, IT operations, quality engineering and security), which coordinate and collaborate together to produce high quality products. By adopting a DevOps culture along with the practices and tools it promotes, teams can meet the needs of their customers, increase confidence in the applications they build, and achieve business goals in less time.\n\nNow, in a technological and corporate ecosystem as fast as the one we live in today, DevOps becomes the perfect tool for teams to function and operate as one and everyone can participate in each stage of the lifecycle of the application and its infrastructure in order to react quickly to business needs and to any eventuality that may arise during product development.\n\n## CUSTOMER AND END-USER PERCEPTION\n\nOne of the main advantages of the DevOps methodology is that, due to its cross-cutting workflow throughout the entire programming process, its implementation generates a sense of real-time monitoring, process control and, ultimately, great customer satisfaction, since we are dealing with an efficient, transparent, moldable and agile service that is delivered in a short range of time and with superior quality. In addition to this, organizations have the advantage that the end user is always at the center of the development and, therefore, iterations, adjustments and tests guide the team and are the raw material to reach the desired product.\n\nThe usability, key data and perspective of both the customer and the end user (their interests and preferences, daily routines, etc.) are the data on which the DevOps methodology is based and which directs the work with the objective of solving real needs and delivering products that meet everyone's expectations.\n\nWhile the culture, the user and their needs must be taken into account when establishing a workflow and a final product, the programmer or organization that is developing software must also rely on the four fundamental bases that this methodology employs to ensure the highest quality standards in their deliverables. Below, we present each of them together with their importance and benefits for the technological projects of the companies.\n\n## PHASE #1: PLANNING\n\nWhen conceiving the idea of a product, it is necessary to plan and establish phases that define and describe the characteristics and functionality of the applications and systems to be created. This planning includes the code writing stage, testing and review of the code, integration and construction by team members. DevOps seeks to solve problems and add functionalities very quickly while maintaining the quality and stability of the final product.\n\nIn this phase, creating backlogs, tracking bugs, managing agile software development with Scrum, using Kanban boards and visualizing progress are just some of the ways DevOps teams plan with agility and transparency. Each team can integrate the work and planning tools with which they feel comfortable as long as a model that is open to all and internalized by each of the areas that will work on the project is guaranteed.\n\n## PHASE #2: DEVELOPMENT AND AUTOMATION\n\nThe development phase includes all aspects of programming (writing code, iterating, reviewing and integrating code by team members) and compiling the resulting code into objects that can be used in different environments. DevOps teams strive to implement innovations quickly without sacrificing quality, stability or productivity. To achieve this, they use highly productive tools, automate daily and manual steps, and iterate code in small steps through automated testing and continuous integration.\n\nIt is this automation that saves time in the execution of mechanical, usually manual, tasks using specialized systems within the development process. Tasks such as compiling and testing software components and publishing the application to end-user environments are some examples of automated tasks.\n\nBut what does it all mean? In a nutshell, a visible gain in process. By enabling standardization, risks associated with manual processes can be prevented. Here are some of the key DevOps tasks that benefit most from automation:\n\n- In code development, automation allows developers to optimize time and thus simplify a project's tasks according to their complexity.\n- In terms of visibility, teams can control all changes that arise from the code, troubleshoot issues, and continuously track bugs as they arise.\n- The monitoring of metrics and large amounts of information is delivered through an automated report. A support that facilitates the compression of information for companies and saves valuable time in the analysis of big data.\n\nIn the development phase, automation becomes necessary and must be employed after due prioritization of events, identification of the root problem within the source code and a proactive methodology full of precision and agility to employ resources in the most efficient way possible.\n\n## PHASE #3 DELIVERY\n\nIn this phase of the DevOps methodology, feedback is integrated into the workflow. This means the measurement of everything that moves in the production line and its subsequent analysis with all team members, to finally move to the delivery of the software to the customer or end user.\n\nIn the delivery phase, the teams define a release management process with clear manual approval phases. They also set up automatic gates that move applications from one phase to the next until they are available to customers. Automating these processes makes them controlled, scalable and repeatable. In this way, DevOps teams can deliver with ease, confidence and peace of mind. It is important to remember that the faster you release new features and adjust bugs, the faster you respond to customer needs.\n\n## PHASE #4 OPERATION\n\nDue planning has already been followed, processes have been automated, and the software has been delivered based on feedback and agility, it is now time to enter the operation phase. This phase includes maintaining and monitoring applications and troubleshooting potential issues in production environments once they have been delivered. DevOps teams seek to identify issues before they affect the user experience and mitigate them quickly when they occur. Once the customer or end user has the product at their disposal, the team begins to perform a complete surveillance of its functionality through actionable alerts and full visibility into the applications and system to monitor that what was planned, developed and delivered is working as expected.\n\nAt DreamCode we are experts in the use of DevOps methodology awnd implement it in all our development projects for our clients. Combined with a unique approach that has benefited small, medium and large companies across the Americas, DevOps takes a leading role in our workflow and development methodology to deliver the highest quality software, on time and aligned with your specific objectives.\n\nIf you want to learn more about how DevOps can give you a great competitive advantage in the market or if you are interested in learning more about our complete development methodology, [go to](https://www.dreamcodesoft.com/en/devops).\n"},{"id":1641358800,"title":"Why the world's most valuable companies use Java","metaTitle":"Why the world's largest companies prefer Java","meta_description":"Reasons why Java is the programming language of major companies around the world and why you should use it.","read":"5min","date":"January 5, 2022","url":"why-the-most-valuable-companies-use-java","imglink":"the-most-valuable-companies-use-java.jpg","category":"up-to-date","content":"\nThe fourth industrial revolution and the acceleration in digital transformation over the past year has left companies wondering which programming language is best for their processes. Amidst so many competitors and new propositions [low-code/no-code](https://www.dreamcodesoft.com/en/blog/the-risks-of-developing-in-no-code-tools), choosing a robust and capable programming language that stands out above the rest can seem overwhelming. The good news is that, in the midst of this highly competitive ecosystem, there is a protagonist that year after year has been able to transform and polish itself to maintain its status as a leader in the business sector. We are talking about Java, the programming language created in 1995 by Sun Microsystems and subsequently acquired by Oracle in 2008 for $7.4 billion.\n\nIn addition to being a cross-platform language, it was one of the pillars of the expansion of Object-Oriented Programming in the 1990s. Much has changed since then and its constant evolution has led it today to rely on the use of frameworks. According to data published by Oracle, Java supports the operation of 97% of corporate computers and is present in 3,000 million cell phones around the world. It is also the favorite language of developers, being chosen by more than 9 million of them.\n\nHere we will explain why Java is still the first choice of small, medium and large businesses in all types of markets and give you the reasons why you should consider using it in your corporate projects.\n\n## Reason #1: Cross-Platform Flexibility\n\nThink of every system and device you know, in more than 90% of them there is an implementation of the Java virtual machine. This potential is gigantic as no other language boasts the status of being present on almost any platform. The fact that Java can run on any server and operating system is one of the reasons why any type of business should consider using it for their projects.\n\nRegardless of the type of company and the devices it has, Java can always be an option that fits any technology budget. It is not necessary to reinvest in specific equipment because for more than 20 years Java has been expanding and polishing its operation in each of the environments where it operates, whether desktop or mobile. Added to this, Java has a peculiarity in relation to all the new versions that have been built over the years and that is that it maintains compatibility one by one, resulting in the code written in previous versions continue to work in the most recent ones. For this reason, user friction and the need to refactor sections of code arise slowly and give plenty of scope for learning and debugging as necessary. This last point makes traditional and more change-resistant organizations such as banks, government companies and others choose Java with the long term in mind.\n\nOf course, this advantage has been relevant for a few years now, because when Java was born it had to adapt to new environments and systems. However, its trajectory and preference continue to grow because it has been able to carry out this adaptation in a professional and careful way, based on the feedback of its users. Users that do not stop growing because they themselves feel that they are part of the growth and debugging of the programming language that they use daily and to which they contribute all their experience and evaluation.\n\n## Reason #2: Versatility\n\nWith such a varied landscape, there are an infinite number of Java applications in programming that strengthen its position as the programming language of choice for companies. Its use is so broad that it can be seen in interfaces, games, applications and complete suites. This development platform allows the creation of desktop Java applications and professional environments using Swing or, in more recent versions, JavaFX.\n\nFrom technology startups, to specialized office software suites, to space research companies, every possible business that uses a digital device is relying on Java for its operations. Here are some examples of large companies around the world that today are leaning towards Java in their different corporate processes so that you can find a first point of contact with the programming language if your business is similar to any of them:\nâ¢ Twitter, Uber and Netflix use Java in their digital interface and structure.\nâ¢ Minecraft, the popular Microsoft game is developed in Java.\nâ¢ NASA uses Java in its maintenance and observation software.\nâ¢ Murex, a trading application, is built in Java.\nâ¢ ThinkFree, an office suite, operates using Java.\nâ¢ Android Studio, the official, free version for Android app development, runs on Java.\nâ¢ Tech giants such as Spotify, Ebay, LinkedIn and Google prefer this programming language.\n\nAs mentioned before, Java has been tested, tweaked and improved year after year, receiving feedback from every single programmer in thousands of industries that use it. Java continues to be the preferred language of programmers because it allows them to:\nâ¢ Write code on one platform and run it virtually on another platform.\nâ¢ Create executable programs in a browser and complement them with available Web services.\nâ¢ Develop server-side applications for forums, warehouses, surveys, HTML form processing and more\nâ¢ Combine environments using the Java language to develop fully customized applications or services\nâ¢ Write custom applications for cell phones, remote processors, consumer products, and virtually any other digital device.\n\nJava's unique versatility lies in the combination of years of debugging, growth in the number of users and types of use and supported devices, ease of use for businesses, developers and end users, and a unique agility in the face of change that is also supported by an enviable experience as one of the first programming languages and development platforms in history.\n\n## Reason #3: Community\n\nOf all the software development communities, the Java community is the oldest and has the most active members in the world. Java includes a huge number of base functionalities, ready to be used from minute one and, in addition, it is available to companies and independent developers, a large amount of third-party code ready to be used. Being an Open-Source platform and having millions of programmers around the world, who over the years have been experiencing difficulties and solving problems in different devices, uses and markets, the Java community is bulletproof.\n\nNo matter how good a programming language is, it would be impossible to survive in such a diverse ecosystem without an active community to help share knowledge and the path to solving common problems on an ongoing basis. For the Java learner, whether part of your company or yourself, the value of this resource is unmatched: from the expert programmer in your IT area, to the recent graduate looking to join your company, for all types of companies and developers, the Java community has a proven, agile and timely solution for all of them.\n\nThere are communities created to help all types of students and professionals. If this is your case, we invite you to make the most of the help of others who, like you, are looking to specialize in the programming language preferred by companies. Also, if you have a business and professionals who use or plan to use Java in their environment, consider taking advantage of these communities to propose a professional training program in your payroll at zero cost.\n\n**In conclusion**\n\nThere are countless reasons why your business should consider using Java for your business processes.

Teams began to see their KPI's closer and closer, the collaborative environment was strengthened exponentially, and end customers were the biggest beneficiaries.\n\nHowever, some companies in the industry felt threatened by the change in their workflows that Scrum was intended to foster. This produced some initial resistance to the methodology that only with time and the verification of its advantages could be mitigated.\n\nTo fully understand all that this methodology brought with it and what it represented for the technology industry, we must first understand it in depth. Here is a brief overview of what Agile Scrum is and how this work methodology has changed the technology industry forever.\n\n## What is Agile Scrum?\n\nAgile Scrum is a working methodology in which a project is approached based on short, fixed duration cycles (in these cases, iterations usually take place every 2, 3 or even 4 weeks, which is the maximum recommended to receive product feedback). When implementing Agile Scrum, each of these iterations must bring about a specific result or product enhancement or benefit, so that it can be delivered to the customer with minimal team effort.\n\nIn Scrum, you make regular, partial deliveries of the final product, prioritized based on the benefit they bring to the project recipient. Therefore, Scrum is particularly well suited for projects in complex environments, where results must be achieved quickly, where requirements are changing or ill-defined, where innovation, competitiveness, flexibility, and productivity are essential.\n\nBy planning and executing these improvements, teams adopt an ideal work rhythm that connects them to the customer's needs, while better understanding the solutions and making continuous and relevant improvements to the final products.\n\n## Reasons why Scrum was a game changer in Technology\n\nYou may have noticed that the process that Agile Scrum attempts to establish is very similar to the process a software developer goes through when reviewing, optimizing, and streamlining his code. That is why this methodology seems to be tailor-made for the IT sector. On this basis, its implementation in the sector occurred in such an organic way that today software companies that do not use it are at a total disadvantage compared to those that do.\n\nHere are the 5 reasons why the Agile Scrum methodology marked a before and after in the world of technology and why you should take it into account as a decisive factor when approaching your software development projects.\n\n## #1 Meeting Expectations\n\nOne of the main reasons why Scrum has been so successful in IT is that customers started to have more clarity in their expectations indicating how much each requirement contributes to the project. From here, the team makes its own estimation and by contrasting this information, it is the Product Owner who establishes its priority.\n\nTo follow up on the progress of these priorities, the Product Owner is also responsible for checking that the most important requirements have been successfully met before transmitting the feedback to the team. In this way, the Agile scrum methodology in IT starts off on the right foot because the objectives and priorities are measured, evaluated, and aligned across the board from the beginning between the customer and the team. The clarity that this simple but grateful process provides avoids necessary iterations, loss of focus and compliance with tangible results.\n\nIn the past, one leader's objectives might not be viewed in the same way by another from another development area. A point of no return was reached where focus was lost, work was wasted, and teams lost motivation to the point where countless ideas that had a bright future died.\n\n## #2 Flexibility to change\n\nIn projects as complex as software development, last minute changes, unexpected adjustments, and the demands of a constantly changing market are the order of the day. Teams that began implementing Agile Scrum in IT realized that this system provides them with a high capacity to react to these changes in both customer and industry requirements.\n\nThe responsiveness of having professionals in roles that seek change and monitor it is high. With properly planned work and the organization of tasks into sprints according to priority and need, adapting quickly and effectively to an adjustment at any stage of the application development lifecycle becomes simple and expected.\nBefore the advent of Scrum, flexibility and responsiveness to a change, a trend or a technology market requirement were nonexistent. Workflows were rigid and change was not in the glossary of any development team.\n\n## #3 Higher software quality and early access\n\nWhen all iterations are on a schedule, the tasks to see the expected results are clear, and a flexible team of deliverables experts monitor the entire workflow around the software development project, the customer has the ability to start using the key functionality they want to achieve long before the product is fully completed.\n\nSimilarly, the iterative work methodology and early customer access to the product lay the foundation for developing superior quality software, with clear expectations and a constant flow of feedback that sets the projects up for success.\n\nAt first it was thought that full customer and process reviewer access to the project would mean roadblocks and wasted resources along the way, but this was quickly demystified when this monitoring and alignment of teams and expectations began to be presented in a structured and agile way that empowered the process and everyone in it.\n\n## #4 Increased Productivity and Return on Investment (ROI)\n\nAgile Scrum provides a considerable improvement in the productivity of software development teams thanks to the elimination of middlemen, and work bottlenecks due to waiting for approvals and/or deferred reviews. Since the roadmap is clear from the outset, the team's motivation thanks to the autonomy they enjoy leads them to better organize themselves and reach their ideal pace.\n\nBy aligning the expectations mainly of the customer, the production of the software project can reach a point where it is only driven by the functionalities that bring the most value to the company thanks to the prioritization of objectives by return on investment. The customer feels that his investment is being optimized at each stage of the digital assembly line through which his idea passes, as a prior assessment is made of which goals represent the highest return and the workflow and team are aligned towards them.\n\nIn the past, productivity was hampered by paperwork, resource authorization, intermediaries who wanted to modify the development or the ego of a leader. Also, priorities were often set based on hunches or \"common sense\" rather than on data that supported ROI.\n\n## #5 Predictive Modeling and Risk Reduction\n\nBy correctly applying the Agile Scrum methodology in IT, it is possible to know with accuracy the estimated, average, and actual velocity of the teams in each sprint (or project checkpoint), making it possible to easily estimate exact dates of availability of specific functionalities that are still under development. This means not postponing software releases, go-lives or deployments, a phenomenon often seen in the industry before the advent of Scrum.\n\nWith all this, planning and monitoring the most valuable priorities first and knowing the speed at which the team is progressing in the project development, allows to reduce possible risks effectively and in advance. Thus, structured action plans for the mitigation of expected risks can be built with enough time to not negatively affect the progress and achievement of project goals.\n\n**In conclusion**\n\nAgile Scrum came not only to stay, but to guide the path of IT projects that want to see the light, have clear expectations, and are developed with agility and flexibility. This methodology represented a paradigm shift that many large companies in the industry had to understand and adopt, as well as one that many others decided not to employ and sank into rigidity and the postponement and even cancellation of large projects, leading them to disappear in a market that demands more and more every day.\n\nAt DreamCode, our clients know and have benefited from the advantages that the Agile Scrum methodology represents for their projects in the IT sector. This methodology is a standard in our workflow, and we have been perfecting its use with every idea we bring to life throughout the Americas.

We know that the efforts to find the teams you need are being excessive and sometimes unsuccessful. That's why today we present the agile alternatives for you to make that digital transformation idea that your company needs so badly a reality.\nBased on the key findings that Gartner found in its recent [2020 - 2022 Emerging Technology for Enterprises](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/trends/emerging-technology-roadmap-gb-pd.html?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=RM_NA_2020_ITTRND_CPC_LG1_H2-GTS-AOC&utm_adgroup=113741808387&utm_term=%2Bemerging%20%2Btechnologies&ad=476672196694&matchtype=b&gclid=Cj0KCQjwqp-LBhDQARIsAO0a6aLy_WvGeZBvv2i1IaEVZwkSD3plLPRxJWinyjh7cgwHgZcnRzssCEwaAi9REALw_wcB), we have compiled for you some best practices and recommendations to show you the advantages of outsourcing alternatives to find the right software development team for your needs.\n\nThe technology companies that will find success in the years to come are those that, before investing in support and maintenance of their operations, first have their need for appropriate talent covered. Don't put off the issue of technology staffing shortages until tomorrow, because the first step to achieving real goals is to have the right team in place.\n\n## How to find the team you need\n\nAccording to the Gartner study, it was found that the lack of the right technology talent represents almost 64% of the reasons why organizations are facing a barrier to digital adoption. If we add to this the fact that the need for transformation and change of companies around the world is skyrocketing, we are left with an ultra-saturated market with few options that, being so scarce, represent a gigantic acquisition cost.\n\nFor your organization not to be left disabled while waiting for a team to become available, first you need to know exactly what type of team you need. Do you have an AI project for heat recognition at events? Do you need expert advice to get on track with debugging and easy access to your databases? Do you plan to develop a personal finance management app for mobile devices? Identify what type of technology staff you need first based on the nature of your project.\n\nFor example, in the case of the idea of AI for heat recognition at event gauges, start by noting the project manager, a senior AI developer, technical experts in thermal sensors, a Java programmer for the system to store data and learn from it through use in different types of events, etc... Your duty is to be as thorough from the beginning to know exactly what kind of roles and positions will make up your ideal team of tech talent.\n\nThis is how we arrive at today's first recommendation-mantra of the day: if the cost is high and the talent is not specialized, it is better to look elsewhere. Today's businesses are not able to overpay for professionals who must invest time in training to be qualified to work on your projects. One of the main advantages of global hyper connection is that it has opened endless opportunities for both companies and technology personnel.\n\nThe solution to the lack of technological talent lies in this hyper connection and it is called Outsourcing. Yes, we know it may sound obvious at first, but surely you do not know in detail the types of Outsourcing for software development that are on the market, their advantages, their strengths and all the potential they present in terms of maximizing resources, process agility and scalability of systems.\nBelow, we present the agile alternatives in technology in the face of the lack of trained (or available) talent in the market today. Analyze well each outsourcing modality and, according to the detailed work you do to detect the pieces that articulate your work team, choose the one that best suits your needs. Keep your focus on the vision of your project and find the points that connect with it.\n\n## Outsourcing Modalities for Software Development\n\nThe Outsourcing market in technology is being governed by three specific modalities nowadays. We are talking about Onshore, Offshore and Nearshore, alternatives that have their advantages and disadvantages and that we will analyze in detail for you.\n\n## Onshore\n\nThe outsourcing model called Onshore is in which an organization contracts services to develop its projects in its own country. It is the most common modality in all types of markets, as well as the most expensive.\n\nThe Onshore outsourcing alternative is the closest to you, since you are working with a company that is in your country or even city. The advantage of Onshore is that you are working with highly qualified software professionals who have the same cultural approach as you. However, this option comes with the highest cost tag. Onshore companies often don't have the right talent available immediately because they can't afford to keep workers free.\nSo, when hiring an Onshore company, you need to consider the time it takes to source, hire, and train the tech talent your company needs.\n\n## Offshore\n\nThe offshore outsourcing model consists of contracting services from companies located in a completely different part of the world from the country of origin. It is the most economical form of outsourcing, but at the same time the one with the most risks and limitations.\n\nOffshore usually refers to working with teams in countries such as India, China, Ireland, or other European countries. While the cost of working with offshore companies or developers cannot be beaten, there are some drawbacks that you should consider before making the decision based on the cost per hour of work.\n\nHaving your development team on the other side of the world, sometimes not speaking your language, and operating in a completely different time zone, makes communication and goal alignment much more difficult. As you may well know, communication and interaction between teams is as important to quality software development as is technical knowledge and experience. Being twelve hours away simply complicates any kind of communication no matter how skilled and inexpensive the tech talent there is.\n\nIn addition, extended response times and lack of communication due to language barriers and cultural differences can end up driving up costs again, as tweaking, and readjusting days later and through poor communication can stall the project and cause stress on the entire team due to the review and adjustment processes. However, if ultimately the lower hourly rate is your priority, the offshore alternative is likely to be the best option for your company.\n\n## Nearshore\n\nThe outsourcing model called Nearshore is where your company acquires the software development service performed by a specialized team in a country close to yours that has a similar time zone.\n\nNearshore works the same as Offshore, except that your company is aligned with professionals who work in time zones very similar to yours and are in close geographic proximity. This makes communication much easier, and the cultural imprint is almost the same. This modality also allows for quicker and more frequent face-to-face visits to your organization (if necessary). Furthermore, compared to the Onshore modality, Nearshore offers considerable cost savings without altering the quality of the project's results.\n\nIts main disadvantage is that in the end Nearshore cannot compete with the hourly rates of the Offshore companies, since as we have already mentioned, this is the lowest cost modality in the market. However, the convenience of being in the same time zone (or a similar one) and having shorter travel times for face-to-face visits not only reduces costs but also stress for you and your company, not to mention that you will have an immediate response capacity and the security of having your team always available when you need them.\n\n## In conclusion\n\nIf you have enough time for an Onshore provider to find, hire and train the professionals you need and enough resources to pay for the whole process, Onshore is the Outsourcing modality you need. If, on the other hand, you are short of budget and you are willing to not have control of the project to reduce costs, considering that you will have little or no response capacity, your ideal Outsourcing modality is Offshore. Finally, if what you need is a customized team of professionals, who work alongside you, provide you with a high response capacity and offer you services at an economical cost, Nearshore is your ideal Outsourcing modality.\n\nAt DreamCode we are experts in Nearshore software development for the Americas.

Well, you should, because its importance will be fundamental for the future of your business. The Chief Information Officer oversees generating the digital transformation of the organization where he/she works. From the acquisition of technological equipment and software, to the adjustment of the project management strategy, the CIO is in charge of supervising all areas where something can be optimized through technology.\n\nThat is why more and more CIOs are being considered for making strategic decisions that have a great impact on the entire organization. We will now talk a little more about this position that is revolutionizing all industries and is gradually becoming essential for companies wishing to remain relevant in the next decade.\n\n## Why is the CIO essential for the future of a company?\n\nShort answer: integration of the technical areas with the business vision. Long answer: the importance of the CIO in a company's future lies in his or her ability to find solution paths or processes that empower the IT team.\n\nHis role takes on special importance in companies that are looking to start a digital transformation or are in the process. The CIO will oversee getting companies to the point they want to get to using the least amount of technical and technological resources to get there. So, without their extensive field knowledge and nose for connections between market needs and their team's capabilities, companies will have a hard time landing their goals and vision into specific processes and connected systems.\n\n## Informed decisions focused on tomorrow\n\nAs anyone who works in technology knows, data has a better opinion. And no one more than the CIO has this mantra engraved inside him. Predictive analytics and data analysis are part of their breakfast. That's why any company that wants to base its decisions on information and wants to measure its results in detail to improve both its business and organizational strategy must have a CIO at the head of its management team.\n\nIf you are at a point where the intuition of your directors and the experience of your managers are not guiding your company towards results, it is time to hire (or change) your CIO. Today's market demands results and investments even more. These demands are most noticeable in the IT area. Therefore, companies can no longer afford to make decisions without a CIO to back up the data behind them.\n\n**In conclusion**\nThere is no doubt that the future of any business lies at the point where vision and technology meet. At DreamCode we know this and as a CIO, we have what it takes to manage the digital transformation of all types of businesses. Tomorrow is built with communication and integration between people and systems; we are passionate about the digital transformation of the Americas.\n\nIf you have a software development project in mind, you are a CTO looking for a reliable and agile team to work with or you are interested in getting to know our company, we invite you to discover a little more about DreamCode.

The promise of these tools to build a software solution by simply plugging in drag-and-drop visual elements sounds great, but what's behind this apparent flexibility?\n\nWe look at the potential threats to security, flexibility and compliance that using these tools can present to your business. Here's who should use these solutions, why they are not a replacement for code development, and how you might be able to use their potential in a way that is safe for your teams and the security of your sensitive data.\n\n## What is a no-code tool?\n\nLow-code/no-code development platforms are types of visual software development environments that allow professional and empirical developers to drag and drop application components, link them, and create mobile or web applications based on it.\n\n## What risks do they pose to my company?\n\nThere are many ways in which empirical developers can expose a company to cyber risks. A common problem when employing these types of tools is that developers are generally weak on the shortest path. If they find an existing or open-source component as per their need, they will use it without thinking about it (and without detailing it) when developing an application.\n\nThe problem is that they choose these no-code/low-code applications without carefully checking the components they use as they are already configured and can be up and running in minutes.\nAnother potential risk is the management, maintenance, and scaling of these applications, as well as the potential increase in infrastructure and storage costs associated with the increased development activity that these platforms enable.\n\n## Amazon Honey Code case\n\nAmazon Honey Code is a recent app template-oriented platform that works by dragging and dropping visual elements for software development. Its simple interface and low learning curve are appealing to professional and empirical developers around the world.\n\nHowever, development industry leaders agree that in no way is this tool a substitute for using code and it will never become one. According to Jason Wong, research vice president at Gartner:\n\"The tool is very lightweight and will not replace custom solutions that companies build.\"\n\n**In conclusion**\n\nThis type of low/no code tools represent a risk if implemented on a large scale or for robust corporate projects. Our recommendation is that they should only be implemented by expert developers to automate simple tasks or to complement a simple requirement, as well as for programming students or MVPs (minimum viable products) development enthusiasts to test simple functionalities. Under no circumstances should these types of tools be considered for the development of finished products or solutions that handle corporate databases.\n\nIf you have an idea in mind about digital transformation or web/software development for your company and you are concerned about its correct development and adequate security, we invite you to know our portfolio of solutions [here](https://www.dreamcodesoft.com/en/services).

Companies began adopting cloud strategies on the fly due to the sheer amount of information that began to flow in all directions and without warning. However, many other companies did not understand the importance of the cloud and never implemented appropriate technologies, ending up stagnant and with an unfavorable digital landscape.\n\nWe want to prevent your business from being in the same situation. That's why today we'll talk to you about the importance of the cloud for business success and why a robust and scalable cloud systems strategy is vital to your competitiveness.\n\n## **The importance of the cloud for Business success**\n\nWhether your work model is to be a return to face-to-face work or to adopt a hybrid dynamic (which is the current global trend) having the agility that comes with your systems in the cloud will be essential.\nMarkets evolve at a frenetic pace and the first thing to consider is how prepared, interconnected, and accessible your data is to respond in a relevant and timely manner to these changes.\n\nIn addition to giving you agility and responsiveness, the cloud also allows you to improve your departments' and teams' ownership of your company. By connecting data with people, you build a collaborative and learning environment that will increase talent retention.\nFor the digital demands of today and, more importantly, tomorrow, giving the cloud the importance and resources it needs will be the tipping point between growing with the market or simply watching it grow from the sidelines.\n\n## **Cloud strategies: the key to effectiveness**\n\nNow that you know the importance of the cloud, it's time to think about a strategy for using it in an effective, secure, and customized way. Start by identifying which areas of your organization would benefit most from cloud systems. Coordinate with your IT department and select those departments that have the greatest need for connectivity.\n\nOnce you are clear on how the cloud will empower your people, evaluate the resources you currently have. From technology equipment to monetary and human capital, everything should be in the picture to structure a cloud systems action plan.\n\nFinally, check whether you can move your data to the cloud with the resources you have and whether you can guarantee its security and accessibility. If not, establish the missing needs before taking on the necessary resources. In the process, the need to hire staff, invest in equipment or find an external provider may come to light. Whatever the case, you will be prepared to guide the digital transformation through the cloud.\n\nGiven the market situation and its demands in digital terms, optimizing cloud technology should be the number one priority for companies that want to stay relevant in this new post-pandemic era.\n\nIf you want to learn more about cloud systems strategies or have a connected data project in mind, DreamCode can provide you with the guide you need to achieve your goals.

Stay with us to discover its importance and optimize your results.\n\nThe pandemic brought with it one of the largest labor migrations in history. Millions of tech industry workers were thrown into a new home-based work environment that went [from necessary to desirable in no time](https://www.dreamcodesoft.com/en/blog/remote-working-in-software-development). This situation, mixed with the opening of hundreds of thousands of remote vacancies globally in the industry, made many professionals rethink their conditions and aspirations.\n\nUnbeatable offers, salaries that exceeded all expectations, benefits, and flexibility for the worker where few of the reasons that increased the rate of resignations and swelled the list of employees of companies with more economic resources. In such an environment, retaining tech talent would seem to be mission impossible. However, at DreamCode we are here to help. We know first-hand the ins and outs of the ever- evolving technology market and we know how to help you adapt your business to it. With that goal in mind, we've compiled some of the reasons that will convince you why retaining tech talent can be a wonderful strategic move that will save you a huge number of resources.\n\n## **The pandemic brought options that threaten retention in technology**\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, we are sure that if you are having a hard time retaining technology talent in your organization right now, it is 80% pandemicâs fault. Maybe one of your top performers received an offer that doubled the salary you were giving him, and he had no choice but to accept. Or maybe you never thought you would compete for talent in your city directly with Google, Amazon, or Apple. The rules of the game have changed and so must your mindset and planning. If you're still not convinced, review the following reasons why retaining tech talent should be the cornerstone of your organization:\n\n## **Reason #1 The loyal employee is scarcer in technology:**\n\nWe've all dreamed of programming for Google, working in web development for YouTube or writing the new multi-million-dollar App that will land us on the cover of Wired. In technology, you must have this dreamy mindset to stay productive. However, this imaginative nature means that most talent in technology is very clear about where they want to go, or at least have that desire in their unconscious. This, far from being a problem, is a golden opportunity to position your business in the mind of your employees as that Google, that YouTube or that space where one day you can develop that multi- million-dollar App.\n\nMake your IT staff feel that they are in that place where they really want to be. Give them facilities in your office to make it resemble that of a technological giant without losing what makes you unique. Provide a weekly space for your team to develop a video game for the company, the new app revolution in homes or a guitar tuner for the deaf, everything is valid if it continues to contribute to the aspirations of your team. Promote a flexible work model that makes tech talent feel that they are on par with anyone in Silicon Valley. Think first about your employees' motivations before their goals for the quarter.\n\n## **Reason #2 The opportunities will continue to multiply:**\n\nAs you well know, the digital transformation train will continue its unstoppable pace for years to come. Large organizations that previously did not have a robust IT department will continue to invest in tech talent, companies around the world will continue to contact talent from your country and thousands of professionals will begin to demand conditions up to the global standard. You must begin to see this environment as a golden opportunity rather than the end of all opportunity.\n\nPerhaps your organization, flexibility, mission, and identity will connect with the employee who is about to leave Google or maybe someone on the other side of the world is dying to work for a company in your industry or your country. Differentiate yourself today and make it clear to everyone why working for you is unlike anything else. This way, the retention of tech talent in your business will be accompanied by unstoppable growth in your brand awareness. And remember, there is no better talent attraction campaign than happy, successful, and proud employees.\n\n## **Reason #3 The cost to a company of losing an employee is twice as high in the technology sector:**\n\nAny company feels the price of losing an effective element that understands the business and directs others toward its goals. But, if we add to this equation the fact that the company is in the technology industry, that price begins to spiral out of control. Trainings, styling, learning previous code, modes, and specifications unique to your organization, these are just a few examples that translate into considerable amounts of time and numbers. So, before you let a developer, engineer or project manager go, think about how many resources you have invested to get that person where they are.\n\nA well-deserved raise will always be cheaper than a process of selection, onboarding, training, and optimization of technological talent. So, in addition to seeing each of your employees as a person with strengths and weaknesses, also consider all the resources it would cost your organization to let him go, as well as all the resources he has managed to gain. Retaining IT staff starts with knowing their true value.\n\n## **How do you retain IT staff while competing against the entire world?**\n\n### **Reason #4 Building an organizational culture takes time:**\n\nWhat makes a technology business palatable to industry professionals is not just its prestige and track record, it's its vision and how good it feels to say you're part of it. Your company should start making efforts to build a culture that resonates in the industry. A slide or a ping pong table won't build loyalty on its own (although you should consider the idea of placing them in the office), what builds loyalty in the long run is feeling part of something that resonates with you. Couple that with a competitive salary and unique benefits, and retention of tech talent is assured.\n\nIf you're worried you can't keep up with the economic or flexible benefits of the industry giants, become a giant with what makes your company unique. Is it small? make your talent a family and care about every need of your staff as if they were your brothers. Is it medium? involve everyone in its growth and recognize appropriately and individually those responsible for each small achievement. Is it large? give every employee a voice and give visibility to their ideas and make your processes and environment flexible for your tech talent. There are always alternatives if you keep searching for them.\n\n## **Reason #5 Performance comes from well-being, not numbers:**\n\nRemember that a listened idea, timely recognition, or honest help is remembered more than the paycheck at the end of the month (although it should arrive healthy and timely). Today's trend and added value of IT positions resides in flexibility and wellness. Work on balancing your work model to one that gives your staff the most freedom without losing track of them, one that leverages all their skills while still allowing you to benefit from them, and one where even if staff return to the office, they still believe they are in the comfort of their own home.\n\nBe resourceful and employ relevant strategies for each of your employees. Remember that each person has unique aspirations and needs, so find a way for your company's vision to align specifically with each of these. Then you will look back and realize that you have built a solid, loyal IT team that has grown with you.\n\nWe hope the reasons we've listed resonate with your tech talent retention strategy for your organization. Remember that, just as the opportunities for professional growth in the industry are growing, so are the alternatives for growth as a brand. The future will belong to those who begin to value their human capital and whose goals are aligned with their needs and aspirations.\n\nAt DreamCode we know the importance of listening to and understanding the needs of our staff. So much so that we recommend, from our own experience, to spare no effort in retaining technology talent, because in the long run this action itself begins to become not only a good business strategy, but the pillar of your values and philosophy. We know that the technology sector is going through one of its best moments and we are excited to imagine where we are going to go in the years to come.

What had to be implemented as a matter of urgency and necessity during the pandemic has yielded such good results that now most software development vacancies are for remote jobs.\n\nThe future of remote working in technology boasts one of the most solid outlooks that any sector can have. But it is specifically remote working in software development that is appearing the most on job boards around the world. If you are studying in an IT-related field, are a professional developer or simply love to stay at home, this is your time to take advantage of the remote work climate in the tech market.\n\n## **Remote work trends in Technology**\n\nAdecco and LinkedIn shared that due to the Covid-19 contingency, some days off began to be included in the job offers related to technology. By 2022, these hybrid models will be present in more than 80% of the vacancies and 50% of them would consist of full-time remote working.\nNowadays it is possible to work remotely in technology and even more so if you plan to do it in software development, as both sources agreed that the positions that most increased their remote demand are all in tech. Specifically, the profiles with the highest demand in remote work are:\n\n-DevOps Developer\n-Software Engineer\n-Full Stack Engineer\n-Front End Developer\n-Back End Developer\n\nLikewise, when addressing this demand in detail, some specific roles come to light.

Build a solid and varied portfolio with all kinds of projects you have built. Everything is valid if it is functional and finished. Don't include Amazon successors that fell by the wayside.\n\nOnce you have your portfolio, take care of your professional networks, and write your profile carefully. Focus on numbers and quantify your achievements, this way your code and applications will stand out as tangible solutions with measurable results. Remember that data is the new measure of decision making and your professional future is no exception.\n\nFinally, if you see that a requirement starts to be repeated in the offers you are most interested in, consider expanding your knowledge in that specific area the requirement is. The advantage you have is that you can get any job with your skills and not due to an impressive diploma.\n\nThese are exciting times for remote working in technology and the opportunities are multiplying. At DreamCode we know that this model will continue to gain momentum and offerings will increasingly adapt to it.\n\nWe are a company that embraces change and is driven by technology trends.

Tips for hiring tech talent","metaTitle":"Tech talent, improve your technology recruitment","meta_description":"Tips for creating a strategy to help you hire tech talent, optimize technology hiring and attract qualified staff.","read":"5min","date":"October 17, 2021","url":"talent-tech-improve-your-technology-recruitment","imglink":"talent-tech-improve-your-technology-recruitment.jpg","category":"up-to-date","content":"\nWe know you've been there: in the process of hiring tech talent there comes a point where people last longer being selected than they do within your company. A better offer, a position abroad, or tailored possibilities cause them to leave without having met your expectations. That's if you were able to find the correct person in the first place, because in today's environment, simply finding available workers in technology is becoming an increasingly difficult task.\n\nIn the U.S. alone, the IT market has been requiring more than 13,000 job openings every month so far in 2021. Add to this the [growing demand for technology staff](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-strategy/most-in-demand-jobs) from the rest of the world and the growing possibility of hiring tech talent remotely, and you will reach the point where your company is in the midst of a frantic bid to attract the few qualified professionals.\n\nFor this reason, we have compiled a series of tips and best practices for companies in the IT sector to make their technology recruitment process competitive, aligned with current market standards and effective in the long term. This way, they will avoid running out of staff to develop their projects in the future and will have a good name in the industry to keep attracting and retaining the key people they need.\n\n## **The challenge of finding talent in a hyper-competitive market**\n\nThe first step to success with a tech talent recruitment strategy is knowing where it is. And no one can tell you where to look better than your own employees. Reach out to your technology department and make a connection with HR so that common channels, behaviors, and sites are easily identified. If the problem is time sensitive, do this survey yourself. Here are some questions you can ask: âOn a day-to- day basis where do you spend the most time online?â, âare you active on LinkedIn?â, âwhen looking for a job offer, which media do you use?â, âwhich news portals do you consume?â, âare you active on any forums?â\n\nGo a step further when making this inquiry and avoid falling into whether your staff prefers one job search site over the other. The way to find the right talent has changed and your company can't afford to make mistakes in technology recruiting.\n\nOnce you have these questions answered and an initial picture of the behavior of the tech talent, it's time to go a little further. The information you or your human talent team has gathered is the basis for creating a detailed profile of the people you are looking for. Start by giving them a name, so it will be easier to see them more human. Continue with their demographic information, their interests, their online and offline behaviors, their family background, their dreams, their aspirations, and every detail that is useful to you. The more information you enter, the better results you will get.\n\nThis profile of your ideal candidate will now be the raw material for your human talent team (integrated with marketing in an ideal environment) to start searching for them. As the leader of the process, add key comments to the profile and focus the search on what makes sense (if your profile calls for a senior frontend developer, highlight the importance of asking as early as possible for years of verifiable experience). As companies around the world are doing, don't rule out looking for the technology personnel you need in other countries. Perhaps the candidate you need sees your foreign company as an opportunity for professional growth. All this information should be clear to you before you start the recruitment process or launch marketing campaigns.\n\nThe information you gather in this process, in addition to optimizing your technology recruiting strategy, will give you a solid foundation for where to focus your retention efforts in the future. For example, if in your research you discovered that you would need young tech talent (interns or recent graduates) and when you ask an intern in your company where he spends his free time, he answers that in a video game streaming platform, you can include in the offer an hour of weekly break to play Mario Kart or a monthly HALO tournament between departments. With actions like that one, you can attract even more tech talent and improve the retention of the current one.\n\n## **Stand out in the market for flexibility and compensation**\n\nContinuing along the line of retention, we want you to know the importance of standing out in terms of internal customer. There is little or no point in conducting research to profile the tech talent you need, if once you find it, colleagues of that candidate tell him that in your organization they did not have a good time in the past or share him a negative experience they had when they were part of your staff. When thinking about a technology recruitment strategy, you should also keep in mind that the \"word of mouth\" of your employees and the reputation of your company are vital.\n\nThis situation is not foreign to the leaders of large global technology companies, who are modifying their hiring models, considering the welfare and needs that the market is demanding. For example, Rob Alexander, CIO of Capital One, communicated that, to differentiate themselves from other companies, they are implementing a continuous learning model at Capital One, in which their tech talent is kept updated, relevant, and trained in the latest software development practices. Imagine that a future candidate is between your offer and one of your competitors, but in the vacancy you offer, he read that in your company the staff have access to continuous and free training. The decision becomes much easier to make.\n\nThe trend of the moment, thanks to last year's pandemic, is moving towards flexibility in terms of work models. Technology personnel are seeing more value in offerings that allow them to work from home or that handle hybrid methodologies that means more freedom to them. This means that, in the near future, this aspect is going to stop being seen as a benefit and become the norm. Keep in mind that the world had to undergo a digital transformation too quickly and the rules of the game have changed forever.\n\nThinking ahead, you can stand out for your flexibility not only by having an attractive work model. You can also employ reward strategies based on results, ability to change roles or departments based on skills, promote monthly days off based on performance, or any other action that turns your process of finding tech talent into one that highlights your flexibility from the beginning.\n\nSpeaking of rewards, the second trend that is being a fundamental part of best practices in technology hiring around the world is a better compensation. The average salary for tech jobs is rising year-over- year, and the covid-19 crisis only made the speed at which compensation is growing in the industry more accretive. Map out what salaries your competitors are offering and start by adjusting your offerings accordingly. Perhaps it's been a long time since you've changed your economic offerings and that's one of the factors why you're not attracting and retaining tech talent.\n\nIf you already have your salaries adjusted, think about performance. We all like to receive an unexpected bonus that validates the quality of our work. Talk to your team leaders and structure performance-based compensation models. Survey your technology staff and ask them what type of compensation they would value most. Since not all your employees will value the possible rewards they can earn in the same way, be flexible and give them a variety of options to choose from that are in line with what your teams need (financial support for further education, a traditional bonus, a role change, a promotion, days off, or other benefits can be part of the compensation options).\n\nWhatever the form in which you decide to attract and retain your tech talent, we recommend that every action you take is data-driven. We are living in a world where guessing is no longer a plan and companies that put the data at the center of their decision-making, are the ones who will lead the conversation in Technology and Innovation. At Dream Code Software we know the importance of informed decisions and we know firsthand that knowing the people behind the positions is of vital importance when making a technology recruitment strategy. It is for this reason that we have gone from just 2 employees in 2013 to over 100 in 2021: we understood from the beginning that flexibility and well-compensated work are the keys to hiring in the technology sector.
