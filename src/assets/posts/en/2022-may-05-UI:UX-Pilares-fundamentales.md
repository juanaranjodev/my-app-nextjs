**User interface (UI) and user experience (UX)** are two design criteria that are currently definitive when it comes to developing high-value applications for users on any platform. In fact, **they are positioning themselves as standards in IT, design and other industries** and therefore it is imperative for both designers and programmers to adopt their precepts in each of their roles.

**Let's start with the basics:**

## What is UI?

In essence **User Interface or User Interface (UI)** is the structural configuration that outlines how users interact with digital products or services. It is responsible for **delivering both immersive and intuitive solutions capable of assertively conveying business value**.

For that purpose the User Interface design seeks a balanced relationship between objects according to their:

- Hierarchy
- Consistency
- Storytelling
- Personalization
- Relevance

## What is UX?

In practice, **User Experience or User Experience (UX)** is the feeling, the degree of satisfaction or **the opinion that is generated in us after interacting** with websites, applications, products, services or brands among others. In short, it is the design and development focused on the human side.
Among the parameters necessary for the User Experience to generate recall, are:

- _Look and feel_ (Visual Impact)
- Credibility
- Accessibility
- Usability
- Navigability

## How are UI and UX integrated in the roles of programming and application design?

Taking into account that the creation of applications and websites is a multidisciplinary activity which involves mainly design and IT development professionals, we will explain below how their roles intervene in this process:

## Design:

- **UI:** UI designers are in charge of the technical task of **developing the sketches and prototypes of the final product** and refining its visual and interactive aspect until it is finalized, relying on the iterative UX design guidelines throughout the process.

- **UX:** The responsibility of a UX designer lies in **evaluating and testing UI designs in order to improve them** by creating tuning parameters according to user behavior.
  These positions are so closely related that it is quite common to find designers who are both UI and UX experts at the same time.

## Programming:

- **Frontend:** Through various programming languages the frontend is in charge of developing the approved user interface, in other words it implements what the UI designer has previously created.

- **Backend:** A backend developer is in charge of developing the internal structure and the connection with servers and databases that the application needs to operate.

Here it is also very common to find developers who are experts in frontend and backend, which are called _FullStack_.
Now that you know the guidelines that govern UI and UX design and understand how the various professional teams interact with each other in the design and development of applications, we hope you can count on us to support your next business decisions.
