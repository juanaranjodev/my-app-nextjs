With thousands of companies migrating their systems to the cloud, questions arise about the types of cloud applications and ways to use them. Previously we talked about its importance and why [your company should use it if it wants to stay relevant in the market](https://www.dreamcodesoft.com/en/blog/the-growing-need-for-cloud-systems), today you will learn the ways in which your company can use it to take full advantage of it.

We know that the main benefit of migrating information and apps to the cloud within a company is the easy and direct access to it. This information is available from anywhere in the world and employees have access to it 24/7 from any type of device, but what is the reason for the high performance of these applications? Undoubtedly the use of resources and the power provided by their providers without the consumption of resources by end users.

All the benefits of having applications in the cloud are summarized in cost reduction and efficiency for companies, by eliminating the high investment in the purchase, installation and maintenance of physical and hardware elements, an organization can increase its productivity and competitiveness in the market.

## The main types of applications operated from the cloud

- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): users can use resources from their hardware provider and thus benefit from the infrastructure provided by that provider. For example, remote access to specialized equipment, database servers, extra equipment that you do not have, etc.

- Software as a Service (SaaS): the user benefits from the capabilities of the software itself. In this case, access to specific solutions is immediate and no software installation is required to access their functionalities.

- Platform as a Service (IaaS): users can connect from a virtual platform and thus the user finally benefits from the capabilities of the software and hardware. This is a mix of the two previous ones, in which your team can remotely access a computer and benefit from all the systems installed on it.

When the use of cloud applications within a company increases and is exploited to the fullest, the organization manages to be impacted within its culture and processes. However, the real challenge lies in ensuring that this impact can be positive and not negative, how is this possible? By directing all efforts and leadership to an agent specializing in infrastructure and cloud environments to evaluate, analyze and direct the migration according to the specific needs of each organization.

As you well know, the use of the cloud to host a company's applications has become mandatory.
