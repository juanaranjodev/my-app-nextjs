The software development life cycle or SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) is a process oriented to produce high-value software that manages to complete its development in the expected time and cost and that, of course, meets or exceeds customer expectations in a timely manner.  
This approach allows development teams to ensure functional and high-quality software by breaking down software construction into specific tasks that can be assigned to direct responsible parties according to the project schedule.

## Why is it important in our industry?

- Its standardized framework allows defining responsibilities and deliverables.
- It helps to plan, estimate and schedule projects.
- Allows for proper tracking and control for each project.
- It makes every aspect of the project visible and allows nothing to be overlooked.
- Reduces risks and increases development speed.
- Saves on specific management costs and overall project cost.
- Promotes better relationships with customers by involving them in the process.

## Steps

### 1. Planning and Analysis

Based on client input, market research and technical information, senior team members assess the feasibility of the project. The terms of the project are then established according to cost estimates, the teams needed and their responsibilities within a schedule of activities.

### 2. Requirements definition

According to the functionalities and capabilities of the required software, the leaders and their teams establish the resources to be used. This information is documented by means of SRS (Software Requirement Specification) applications where all the design and development aspects that will be taken into account during the whole project life cycle are detailed.

### 3. Design, architecture and prototyping

Following the SRS document, designers and developers present the best possible structure to create the software. Usually more than one approach to approach the creation is proposed and this is included in detail in a DDS (Design Documentation System) document.

### 4. Construction and development

It is time for the software to start its production phase. According to the size of the project and the DDS, this task can be performed by one or several developers. Here all the tools and resources foreseen are used so that the completion of the software is achieved in a detailed and orderly manner.

### 5. Testing and adjustments

Once the software has been completed, the necessary pre-tests are initiated so that its defects are reported, tracked and retested to meet the product requirements and quality standards established in the SRS document.

### 6. Deployment and maintenance

In this final stage the product is launched to the market under constant monitoring in which its availability and access are taken care of according to the growing database of its new users.

## Most recognized and used models

1. Waterfall
2. Agile
3. DevOps

It should be noted that there are other SDLC models, but the previous ones are the most recognized due to their simple implementation and optimal results in recent years. However, this information will be expanded by our team in future contents.
Finally, the most relevant aspect of SDLC is the global vision it provides to developers and customers about the details of the project, its plan to fulfill them and the resources needed to complete it. It is important to keep in mind that in any initiative or technological need in your company it is essential to rely on solid and experienced teams, like the ones we have at DreamCode, to establish the best life cycle according to your project and your business objectives.
