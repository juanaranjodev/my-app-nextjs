Surely you have heard of agile software development, however, today you will learn what Agile Testing is, the winning card behind the optimization and agile culture in technology that is boosting the results of thousands of teams and companies around the world.

The term Agile Testing encompasses a series of product testing practices throughout its development. These practices are employed by each of the teams involved in the construction of the software, and it centers its operation on the role of a tester: a multifunctional expert who dominates and knows all aspects of the production line.

## The Pillars of Agile Testing

At the core of Agile testing are the pillars that guide the team and keep it focused and productive in the face of constant and automated testing. These pillars function as the foundation of the agile development culture and, when well-integrated into the team, can be the catalyst for the success of the software development project. These pillars are:

**Agile Testing saves valuable time**

Following traditional methods, testing and testing occurs at the end of a development phase and if successful, the product is sent back to previous instances for adjustments. In contrast, using Agile Testing provides continuous feedback, allowing for real-time fixes during software development.

**Everyone is a tester in the team**

While the main tester role in each team is fundamental to guide the adjustments, in Agile Testing everyone involved in software development also runs tests in order to internalize the culture of constant testing.

**The customer guides the iterations**

The basis of Agile Testing is feedback, both from each member of the teams involved and from the customer. It is the latter who is present in each iteration and provides his feedback, with which the adjustments have their north.

**The code must be transparent**

In case of bugs, errors or adjustments that need to be made, the code should remain as clean as possible and new versions should be properly explained so that the whole team is on the same page.

**Automation of Prevention**

As we said earlier, Agile Testing is based on the prevention of errors or bugs, as opposed to traditional methods that focus on finding and correcting them. Automating these tests and encouraging constant monitoring through internal software guarantees the maximization of resources.

We invite you to include these pillars at the center of your monitoring and testing strategies when approaching a software development project. Agile Testing may be the strategy you were looking for to bring out the full potential of your teams, while optimizing quality, delivery times and the satisfaction of your customers and their end users.
