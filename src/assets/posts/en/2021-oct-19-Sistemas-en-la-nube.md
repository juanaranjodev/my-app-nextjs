The need for interconnectivity during the pandemic put cloud systems at the center of the digital transformation conversation. Companies began adopting cloud strategies on the fly due to the sheer amount of information that began to flow in all directions and without warning. However, many other companies did not understand the importance of the cloud and never implemented appropriate technologies, ending up stagnant and with an unfavorable digital landscape.

We want to prevent your business from being in the same situation. That's why today we'll talk to you about the importance of the cloud for business success and why a robust and scalable cloud systems strategy is vital to your competitiveness.

## **The importance of the cloud for Business success**

Whether your work model is to be a return to face-to-face work or to adopt a hybrid dynamic (which is the current global trend) having the agility that comes with your systems in the cloud will be essential.
Markets evolve at a frenetic pace and the first thing to consider is how prepared, interconnected, and accessible your data is to respond in a relevant and timely manner to these changes.

In addition to giving you agility and responsiveness, the cloud also allows you to improve your departments' and teams' ownership of your company. By connecting data with people, you build a collaborative and learning environment that will increase talent retention.
For the digital demands of today and, more importantly, tomorrow, giving the cloud the importance and resources it needs will be the tipping point between growing with the market or simply watching it grow from the sidelines.

## **Cloud strategies: the key to effectiveness**

Now that you know the importance of the cloud, it's time to think about a strategy for using it in an effective, secure, and customized way. Start by identifying which areas of your organization would benefit most from cloud systems. Coordinate with your IT department and select those departments that have the greatest need for connectivity.

Once you are clear on how the cloud will empower your people, evaluate the resources you currently have. From technology equipment to monetary and human capital, everything should be in the picture to structure a cloud systems action plan.

Finally, check whether you can move your data to the cloud with the resources you have and whether you can guarantee its security and accessibility. If not, establish the missing needs before taking on the necessary resources. In the process, the need to hire staff, invest in equipment or find an external provider may come to light. Whatever the case, you will be prepared to guide the digital transformation through the cloud.

Given the market situation and its demands in digital terms, optimizing cloud technology should be the number one priority for companies that want to stay relevant in this new post-pandemic era.
