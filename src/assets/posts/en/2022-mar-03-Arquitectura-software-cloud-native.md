The cloud native software architecture represents today an opportunity not only to streamline and optimize processes for companies, but also to value its price in the market exponentially. Previously we talked about how fundamental it is [to have cloud services to remain relevant](https://www.dreamcodesoft.com/en/blog/types-of-cloud-applications-how-to-benefit-from-them), there we learned that more than an alternative, the cloud should be a priority and a necessity for businesses with long-term ambitions.

Today we will tell you about the architecture that allows you to leverage cloud services and connectivity so that you can take full advantage of this must have and your organization can achieve its IT goals.

## What is Cloud Native?

The term Cloud Native refers to a software development model in which applications are designed to be functional in the cloud from the beginning. The result of implementing this architecture is cloud-native software or NCA (Native Cloud Application), which can take full advantage of the benefits and capabilities offered by the cloud.

Cloud-native is a modern approach to building and running software applications that takes advantage of the flexibility, scalability, and resiliency of cloud computing. The term encompasses the various tools and techniques currently used by software developers to build applications for the public cloud, as opposed to traditional architectures that are tailored to an on-premises data center. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) defines Cloud Native by focusing on application integration, where applications are broken down into microservices and packaged in lightweight containers to be deployed and orchestrated across multiple servers.

## The pillars of Cloud Native Architecture

This development model is based on pillars that complement and are independent of each other. To begin with, the microservices and technologies that have been custom-developed for the cloud environment must fulfill a unique and specific function that connects with all the essential elements to run correctly with the others. Secondly, the strategic aspect must be shaped by DevOps processes and the continuous delivery model. To design a well-functioning Cloud Native Architecture, both development and operations teams must be involved.

Quality Cloud Native software is created in full collaboration between all teams involved. In this sense, to build an agile DevOps culture, the best solution for the end user must be thought of from the beginning: by fostering constant communication with the customer, the development team is adding certain features to a microservice, these, in turn, are automatically validated through continuous delivery processes.

The fundamental characteristic of the Cloud Native Software Development Architecture is precisely that it is conceived through these [microservices](https://www.dreamcodesoft.com/en/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-microservices), which are hardly linked to each other and are independent of each other as well as of the corresponding infrastructure. The key is that the communication between them is carried out through standardized [API](https://www.dreamcodesoft.com/en/blog/API-driven-Architecture-simplifying-software-development) interfaces that allow the end user to have the feeling of interacting with a single application. As a result, services are designed in such a way that they could be part of a completely different piece of software. The potential this allows is that microservices can be freely combined, copied and reused depending on the needs of the project.

**Cloud Native Architecture at DreamCode**

The Cloud Native Architecture model is an active part of the software development process at DreamCode. We have seen firsthand its usefulness in process optimization, team integration and agility in the face of trends or changes that the market generate. Also, through previous projects all across America we have improved and refined its use.
