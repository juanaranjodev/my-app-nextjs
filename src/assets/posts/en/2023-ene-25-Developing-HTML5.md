A growing trend indicates that both companies and programmers are looking for technological innovation through the development of efficient, sustainable, scalable and, above all, low-cost web or mobile applications. This has brought into consideration the viability of HTML5 since it is a simple, versatile, developer-friendly and open source language, which means that it does not require any investment for professional use. For that reason, in this article we will break down roughly what is involved in developing mobile applications with HTML5 to better understand this technological trend.

## What is an HTML5 app?

HTML5 allows the creation of WORA (write once run everywhere) applications, which in Spanish translates as "write once run everywhere" applications that can be executed in any environment.

Structurally, these apps are a collection of web pages based on HTML code which are delivered by means of CSS style sheets in conjunction with JavaScript. In this way HTML5 apps achieve the integration of different structure and design elements along with the necessary APIs for proper deployment on multiple devices and platforms.

## Which are the pros and cons of developing HTML5 apps?

### Pros

**Learning and implementation**

On a general level, HTML is the starting point where developers begin their professional journey. This demonstrates its ease of learning and ensures that there will always be talent available for development compared to other languages.

**Investment and profitability**

HTML5 does not require royalty payments to be implemented in professional projects. In addition, its cross-platform deployment prevents companies from having to develop native applications for each platform.

**Adaptability and integration**

HTML5 applications adjust to the resolutions, screen sizes and aspect ratios where they run. They also integrate seamlessly with the operating system of any device.

**Maintenance and Upgradeability**

The clean, clean code achieved with HTML5 ensures easy-to-maintain applications. Also, updating it is uncomplicated and requires no action on the part of users.

### Cons

**Permissions and access**

HTML5 cannot access all the functionalities of cell phones, in fact it can only do so through APIs and this can limit its capabilities and advantages over native applications.

**Communication and deployment**

HTML5 was developed quickly and has not yet solved some compatibility bugs in the deployment of CSS attributes, HTML tags and JavaScript APIs, this can generate communication failures on some devices.

In conclusion, despite having certain disadvantages, there are more successes that the development of HTML5 apps can achieve. This has motivated companies like Intel to generate campaigns to help programmers to achieve a transition from the native environment to the multiplatform environment proposed by HTML5.
If your company has the challenge of implementing one or more cross-platform mobile applications, HTML5 is probably the ideal language to face this task and overcome it with peace of mind, but first, you need to have the right team to develop this solution.
