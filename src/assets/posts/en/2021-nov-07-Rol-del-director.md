Have you heard of the CIO? Well, you should, because its importance will be fundamental for the future of your business. The Chief Information Officer oversees generating the digital transformation of the organization where he/she works. From the acquisition of technological equipment and software, to the adjustment of the project management strategy, the CIO is in charge of supervising all areas where something can be optimized through technology.

That is why more and more CIOs are being considered for making strategic decisions that have a great impact on the entire organization. We will now talk a little more about this position that is revolutionizing all industries and is gradually becoming essential for companies wishing to remain relevant in the next decade.

## Why is the CIO essential for the future of a company?

Short answer: integration of the technical areas with the business vision. Long answer: the importance of the CIO in a company's future lies in his or her ability to find solution paths or processes that empower the IT team.

His role takes on special importance in companies that are looking to start a digital transformation or are in the process. The CIO will oversee getting companies to the point they want to get to using the least amount of technical and technological resources to get there. So, without their extensive field knowledge and nose for connections between market needs and their team's capabilities, companies will have a hard time landing their goals and vision into specific processes and connected systems.

## Informed decisions focused on tomorrow

As anyone who works in technology knows, data has a better opinion. And no one more than the CIO has this mantra engraved inside him. Predictive analytics and data analysis are part of their breakfast. That's why any company that wants to base its decisions on information and wants to measure its results in detail to improve both its business and organizational strategy must have a CIO at the head of its management team.

If you are at a point where the intuition of your directors and the experience of your managers are not guiding your company towards results, it is time to hire (or change) your CIO. Today's market demands results and investments even more. These demands are most noticeable in the IT area. Therefore, companies can no longer afford to make decisions without a CIO to back up the data behind them.
