Outsourcing of services is a business alternative of high strategic value for businesses due to its high rates of efficiency, savings and accuracy in the selection of talent. In this market, Latin America has emerged as a great source of highly qualified and competent technological human resources, thanks to regional development and national investments. As a result, Colombia has managed to position itself as a new regional power for IT outsourcing and here we will learn what have been the internal and external keys to its incursion into this market.

## Latin America, the world's third IT outsourcing hub

In Latin America we share a cultural proximity that in one way or another allows us to be a compatible region in various aspects of professional and business development. If we add to this demographic variable our educational quality in the preparation of technological talent and the competitiveness of our prices in professional services compared to those of developed countries, we can understand what has been the progressive formula that has allowed us to compete in the production of skilled workers for the technology sector, placing us as the third area of global opportunity where businesses around the world can benefit from high quality IT talent at low cost.

Every year in LATAM we produce around 800,000 professionals in various technology fields, and as one of the territories with the fastest adaptation and adoption of digital transformation, our region is supplying the talent the world needs to address the shortage of IT professionals in the world.

Within the highly skilled IT workforce produced in Latin America, the most prominent profiles are:

- Software Developers

- Data Engineers

- Digital Security Experts

- Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Specialists

- UX Designers

## Colombia, a new IT outsourcing powerhouse has emerged

For several years, IT outsourcing was concentrated in Europe and Asia, and although China and India continue to lead this market, countries such as Brazil, Mexico, and now Colombia, have become a great source of resources thanks to their production of qualified professionals and their affinity with Western business values.

According to Statista, the IT outsourcing market projects an annual growth of 6.4% until 2025, this is due to factors such as educational technical specialization and regional investment in technological infrastructure to ensure the competencies and sufficiency of our professionals in the national and global business sectors.

These policies have positioned Colombia as an attractive and booming business destination, where businesses can find a wide range of services, natural resources, infrastructure and high-quality technological talent at prices competitive with leading countries such as Argentina, Brazil and Mexico.

Colombia is also a developing country which, on the one hand, allows companies to reduce their operating costs without compromising the quality of their products or services and, on the other hand, thanks to the investment that the national government is allocating to critical areas such as technological infrastructure, interconnectivity and tax incentives to support training and research, has managed to create a very fertile environment for growth and global business development.

According to the Colombian Chamber of Information Technology and Telecommunications (CCIT), the country is registering a sustained growth of 10% per year in the IT and communications sector. In addition, thanks to its geographical location, Colombia has become a strategic destination with an evolving technological culture where companies can deploy their operations and have sufficient IT talent.

## The future outlook

As an alternative to Europe and Asia, and even Brazil and Mexico, Colombia is experiencing a moment of high consideration by the business world. This is undoubtedly a great opportunity for the country, in which both companies and collaborators need to focus on promoting technological evolution and professional development as essential tools to make the most of this situation.
