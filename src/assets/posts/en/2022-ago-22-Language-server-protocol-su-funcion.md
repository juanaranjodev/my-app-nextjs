Language Server Protocol or LSP is a communication standard originally created by Microsoft with the objective of defining a better protocol between a source code editor or **the IDE implemented by the developer and the servers** that contain all the specifications and functions of a specific programming language.

Thus, by means of the LSP standard you will be able to create a single server capable of supporting editors such as Visual Studio Code or Eclipse IDE and vice versa. In addition, **you will find a huge availability of libraries for other languages such as Java, Haskell or PHP**, in case you need to implement this protocol from your own development.
Learn a little more about this standard in this article as it can help you in the creation of new tools.

## How does LSP work?

For this case we will quote the official description of a session made by [Microsoft](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2016/06/27/common-language-protocol):

● **User opens a document:** The editor notifies the server of this action (**didOpen**) and that it has the document in memory.

● **User edits the document:** The editor informs the server about the changes (**didChange**) The server analyzes the information and notifies the possible errors and warnings found (**diagnostics**)

● **User requests a specific command:** Here the user can ask for a definition (**definition**), the completion of the text from the current cursor position (**completion**) or help with a signature (**signatureHelp**), etc. Then the publisher sends the request and the server responds appropriately so that the publisher satisfies the user's request.

● **User closes the document:** The publisher notifies the language that the user has closed the document (**didClose**) and that the document is no longer in memory.

## What are its features?

**LSP is designed to better support languages with dedicated fields for accessing and reading a symbol**, but it cannot operate on binary code.
Language Server Protocol **has been created with source code editors and local development as parameters**, but nothing limits its implementation with other tools such as MySQL or Workbench.

## Its role in the technological industry

If as a programmer you are interested in the development of programming languages **LSP is a fundamental tool to support allowing the language designer and the tool programmer to accept new developments** from other editors. In this way LSP is positioned as a tool capable of guaranteeing the globalization of your new language.
