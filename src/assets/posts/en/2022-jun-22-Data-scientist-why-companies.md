With an average of 2.5 quintillion bytes of data created daily, we are at an important milestone where the technology industry needs to be able to store, structure, understand and convert this data into cross-cutting and significantly practical information in multiple areas. This is where the role of the Data Scientist takes center stage and today we will delve into how valuable it is for the business sector.

## Big Data, the ideal scenario

As we mentioned in a previous article, [Big Data](https://www.dreamcodesoft.com/en/blog/tremendous-potential-behind-big-data-and-its-analytics-tools) refers to the information that usually comes from web applications and mobile devices which is quite massive and very complex to process using traditional methods.

But Big Data would not be relevant today without the work of professionals capable of converting interaction patterns into actionable and applicable information. These computer experts are what we know as Data Scientists and more and more organizations are taking advantage of their expertise to unlock the commercial power that lies within Big Data.

## Who are Data Scientists?

To be competent and capable of taking responsibility for processing the vast amounts of data into information of high business value, Data Scientists must first and foremost be professionals skilled in mathematics, statistics and computer science. In addition, their broad expertise is usually a cross-disciplinary background in areas such as infrastructure design, cloud computing and data mining and management among others.

## What does your role bring to the business world?

In a world like ours where we produce overwhelming amounts of data knowing how to capture it, navigate it, master ways to leverage it and make sense of it is a crucial factor in the future of business.
Consequently, these are the advantages of having a Data Scientist in your company:

1. Better decision making by managers and company leaders.
2. Recognition of essential objectives and taking actions based on recognized trends.
3. Design and implementation of best business practices.
4. Identification of improvement opportunities and new business initiatives.
5. Testing of possible decisions and new business deployments.
6. Target audience profiling and refinement.
7. Exploration and recruitment of suitable human talent.

In short, Data Scientists are professionals highly capable of providing great value to companies in any industry, which is why, according to The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the labor supply for this professional profile is expected to grow by 27.9% by the year 2026, opening new positions in the technological teams at the heart of organizations.
