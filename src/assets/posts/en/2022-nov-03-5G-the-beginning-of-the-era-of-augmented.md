The mass adoption of augmented reality was unthinkable until relatively recently, but thanks to the emergence of the fifth generation of mobile networks (5G), the benefits of this revolutionary technology have been unlocked. Therefore, in this article we will review how the deployment of 5G networks has become the gateway to a new level of technological development.

## What is 5G?

5G is the new global wireless standard for mobile networks through which virtually everything would be interconnected, from machines, devices and objects in sectors such as health, education, security, finance, entertainment, mobility and, in general, all thanks to the power of 5G connections is something never seen before.

This mobile technology relies on OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) which is a model capable of modulating signals on multiple channels to avoid interference in their flow. It also makes use of better air transmission interfaces through wider bandwidths, which allows 5G technology to provide access to more people and objects.

5G has been developed with the purpose of offering connection speeds of around 10 Gbps stable while having low latency (time taken by the network to transmit data). This translates into greater reliability, availability and outstanding performance, which improves the user experience allowing the entry and development of new industries.

In this context, its growth opportunities are almost infinite since 5G has the capacity to unleash a wave of disruptions in multiple sectors thanks to its transformative power. A clear example is the entertainment, health, education or automotive sectors, where we will soon be able to visualize animated holographic overlays in real time that will allow us to enjoy musical plays, sporting events, remote medical care, contemplate the representation of historical events or receive real-time instructions on how to assemble the parts of a car, all in a more vivid and immersive way.

## The role of this technology in the development of augmented reality

It is said that the activation of 5G connectivity will be what marks the operational start of augmented reality, this due to its fast data transfer rates and limited interference in real-time visual reproductions. Given that augmented reality needs connections with higher bandwidths and low, if possible zero, interference, these are the two pillars of 5G on which it will be able to develop its true potential:

### Ultra high speed:

With a download rate of around 10 GigaBytes per second (Gbps) versus 1 Gbps as the theoretical maximum available in 4G LTE-A networks (the fastest and most stable at present), real-time transfer of high-resolution data is expected to meet the requirements of augmented reality.

### Ultra low latency:

Latency is the time it takes for a data packet to reach its destination within a network from the time it initiated its request. In today's networks it averages 50 milliseconds (ms) and with 5G it should be reduced to a mere 10 ms. This is a key factor when the goal of augmented reality is to overlay information and virtual elements on real-world scenes in real time.

On a qualitative level, 5G networks are more reliable, capable, available and uniform allowing its users to access new experiences and engage with new industries. In this way it will bring benefits such as:

- Advanced and remote medical care
- More realistic video games
- Non-face-to-face visits to real environments
- Sports experiences without changing physical space
- Telecommuting to a new level
- More accurate and effective marketing

In colloquial terms, what augmented reality needs to reach new levels of deployment is to have an agile response from servers to user requests making use of today's top broadband speeds but this time on mobile networks.

## How can enterprises and businesses capitalize on the potential behind the 5G architecture?

Considering that 5G networks have high range connections, low latency and quasi-infinite capacity, the activation and deployment of augmented reality will be widespread in both individuals and industries.

According to recent publications from the World Economic Forum, augmented reality is one of the technologies that will reshape human interaction with the virtual world and this undoubtedly means that the business opportunities for corporate segments will be virtually endless, in short, we are opening the doors to a new world.

As a result, smaller companies will be able to compete with larger players in their sector because they will be able to access better technology and infrastructure without having to invest heavily. This will have an economic effect that will not only materialize augmented reality but will also impact the entire world economy.

## What can we expect for the software development industry?

Since before the implementation of 5G as a catalyst for technologies such as augmented reality, the arrival of this new standard is expected to drive innovation and promote a more competitive software market. It is also expected that many of the limitations that the software development industry currently has will disappear and this will allow on the one hand to rethink what we have created and on the other hand to consider what previously had no opportunity for development.

In the software development industry, solutions are limited by the technologies for which applications are created, therefore this new paradigm will set new limits under which both nearshore and offshore development teams will be able to add value in:

- **Adding new functionalities to both sites and applications:**
  With the possibility of bypassing speed and latency issues, development teams will be able to include new functionalities in their applications without being limited by performance, which is a guaranteed place for augmented reality.
- **Implementing better quality images, audio and video:**
  Implementing better quality images, audio and video.
  The transmission of high quality content on mobile devices will be something never seen before. In addition, graphical sophistication and fluidity will increase the realism of video games and other virtual experiences.
- **Increasing levels of digital security:**
  Increased data transfer requires better security schemes for users' devices. This is why various biometric tools are currently being developed that will enable a more personalized level of security.
- **Design and develop new levels of technological services:**
  Applications that operate in real time will be able to benefit from a high rate of data transmission with which developers will be able to take firmer steps in services such as passenger transportation in driverless vehicles, robotic business logistics and intelligent traffic systems, among others.

In addition to the above, the software development industry will be transformed from its foundations because a new level of creative freedom implies a change of mentality and this in turn derives in a change of paradigms and processes under which a new era will begin for the programmers of the future.

In short, 5G connectivity is a milestone that will revolutionize the lives of both individuals and businesses by promoting its own revolution of other underlying technologies that are waiting for a wider and more stable data flow.
