Today's companies and markets function thanks to the information obtained from data processing. This has opened the door to a world of benefits for businesses, which today enjoy better decision making in operational, executive and administrative scenarios, regardless of their size or industry.

Consequently, we can estimate that data has become the most valuable raw material that a company has to produce better results in its initiatives, therefore ensuring its storage, management and availability should be considered as a critical objective for the business and data centers are the best strategic ally to achieve it.

## A look inside a data center

A data center is a physical facility that houses storage equipment and server networks that are interconnected for the purpose of storing data, processing it and distributing the information obtained quickly and securely to whoever needs it.

Within the operating cycle of a data center, servers are high-performance computer equipment that work to manage and process data. This data is stored on solid state drives (SSD), hard disk drives (HD) and disk arrays (RAID) to ensure data preservation in any scenario.

Connections between processing equipment, storage units and the web rely on high-capacity networks, which have a high data throughput rate to store, share and preserve their users' information.

In other sections, these dedicated facilities have their own systems to properly manage the hardware that makes up the data center and in turn allow them to maintain their operation continuously and free of obstacles. Also, if required, data centers are scalable and have the ability to expand and adapt to offer more resources to meet a given demand for both storage and processing.

Today, these data centers play a fundamental role in the existence and execution of all kinds of applications and other online services such as cloud computing. In this way, they have become fundamental systems for the operational infrastructure of many companies and businesses around the world.

## The strategic value of a data center

Taking into account the imperative relevance that exists around information and its proper management in today's business landscape, these are the scenarios where a data center can contribute to the success of business operations today:

### Centralized storage and management.

Hosting, processing and managing business-critical enterprise information is an advantage that directly impacts on improved operational efficiency at multiple levels and high savings in time and economic capital.

### Digital security

Peace of mind for the business operation is a managerial advantage that comes from the assurance and protection of information from any breach thanks to the layers of security that data centers possess.

### Redundancy and preservation

The use of various storage systems provides the necessary redundancy so that data is always available for any call. This allows information to be recovered and preserved in the event of a cyber attack or operational failure.

### Scalability

For those companies that experience accelerated growth or a peak in their operational demand, scalability is an advantage that data centers use to adapt to the particularities of the business in order to guarantee their productivity in any scenario, without the need for a new infrastructure.

### Cost reduction

By using the services of a data center provider, companies can avoid the high costs of storing and processing information internally. This frees them from the need for storage and interconnection infrastructures, professional staff and maintenance costs associated with setting up their own data center.

### Increased credibility

By relying on the services of a data center, companies will be able to devote their efforts to other areas than improving the delivery of their products and services, which will have a positive impact on their customers' perception and enhance their brand reputation within the market.

## Our conclusion

With the growing need to deliver better user experiences as a key tool to increase profitability, companies are challenged to find a balance between their operational and commercial tasks, which are so changing today. In this sense, data centers are capable of providing what is necessary to satisfy productivity in different business areas.
