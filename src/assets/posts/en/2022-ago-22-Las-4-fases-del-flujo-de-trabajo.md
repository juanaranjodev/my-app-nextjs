From ideas captured on paper and flowcharts, to models and prototypes and finally to debugged code, **application development today has become a carefully structured process** as a result of technological evolution.
Although it is true that the structure of each application is different and the details vary from product to product, it is clear that there is a generic scheme for its creation and through this **development teams have a workflow on which they can deliver value from start to finish** conceptualizing ideas with speed and quality.
Therefore, in this article we will break down **the four phases that software developers go through to produce modern, accurate and flawless applications**.

## 1. Pre-design

In this initial stage is where **the application market is studied, its audience is analyzed and also what is known as benchmarks** or reference studies are executed in case there are similar applications in order to gather accurate information to turn it into a _'brief'_, which is essentially the roadmap that allows moving in the right direction to develop the right application.

## 2. Design

Once the strategic approach and its tactical execution have been established, it is time to design the application that will provide a solution to the brief.
Roughly speaking, **at this stage the interface design (UI) and user experience [(UX)](https://www.dreamcodesoft.com/en/blog/ui-ux-crucial-components-for-development-high-value-web-applications) of the future application will be structured** and the process is iterated until the requirements are met.
This will result in a finalized visual design and UX flow that will allow **creating a functional prototype that can be tested among some users** or _testers_ giving shape to a final model that can be built by the developers.

## 3. Development

In simple terms, this is where the application is built and released, according to our methodology, this process is done in development _sprints_ to create certain functionalities of the application.
At the end of each sprint a compilation of the code is done with the purpose of checking the fulfillment of the objectives internally and thus be able to deliver results in a granular and transparent way for the customer to check and approve from start to finish.
To finish this phase **some iterations are made in order to refine the final product and release the application** in app stores or websites where the client requires it.

## 4. Support

Regardless of the number of iterations and final adjustments that have been made **there is always the possibility that the application may fail in its release period** either due to external factors such as installation on old devices or outdated operating systems.
Therefore, **it is of vital importance for clients to prepare for this type of inconvenience when making a budget calculation for their application** (normally between 15% and 20% is allocated). In this way they will have sufficient resources to deal with unexpected errors, handle eventualities that may arise, take advantage of new opportunities and plan for the growth of their application.
