Big Data refers to the massive and complex information to process using traditional methods. But that complexity is not a limitation, and it shouldn't be, since **within that great mass of data lies insights that can become a high-value asset for business.**

Big Data is a new paradigm which demands new tools for data analysis because its goal is not to possess a large amount of information, because this is growing exponentially every day, but rather **what companies can extract from the raw data.**

## How is this data generated?

To put Big Data as a concept in context, let's think about the information we generate on a daily basis, that is, from the moment we wake up until we go back to bed. Probably the first thing we do is check our mobile, open our mail, check our social networks, news portals, entertainment apps, traffic, etc. **This is repeated on our way to work, in our offices, back home and so on**.

This interactive behavior generates footprints or traces that are printed and stored in the applications we have on our computers, which have **capture systems and infrastructures for storing raw data** that allow them to obtain information at all times, whether we are traveling or resting.

A clear example of Big Data applied to our daily lives are mobility apps, such as Google Maps, Waze and Moovit, among others. Thanks to capturing and processing of data from other users, they are able to give us very accurate information in real time (arrival time, traffic alerts, alternative routes, etc.) about our trips from start to finish.

## Which are its advantages?

Currently **there is a very high demand for scientific, technical and professional staff for the development of new analytical tools due to the great potential that big data has** in virtually all human fields as long as we continue to use electronic devices in our daily lives.

So we can say that **its advantages could be infinite** but we will state the most common ones so far. Companies that implement Big Data analytics have achieved:

- Reduction of costs and operating times.
- Optimization of processes and development of new products.
- Better decision making.
- Improved offerings to their customers.
- Increased operational security
- Refined knowledge about your audience and their preferences.

## In what scenarios can Big Data be applied?

If you are considering the idea of adopting this practice, **it is quite natural to think that you can do so in diverse and multidisciplinary processes** such as marketing, production, decision making, research, etc.

## Here are the 5 most relevant applications of Big Data:

1. Business and finance optimization.
2. Best practices in performance for the sports world
3. Optimization of cities and metropolitan areas in terms of safety, traffic, public health, etc.
4. Successful management of technology and resources.
5. Transformation in science and research processes.

In summary, **Big Data is a source of information that needs to be processed accurately using the most appropriate technological tools for data extraction**, since its usefulness is focused on dictating new guidelines for business efforts. That is why **there is now a high demand for the development of high-precision tools that allow us to exploit this great resource** in the most effective way.
