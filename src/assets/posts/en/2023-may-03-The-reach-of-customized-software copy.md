In contrast to the commercial software that you find available in the market for a wide variety of companies, custom software is a type of solution designed and developed with the sole purpose of satisfying the needs and requirements of your particular business.
Currently, due to its commercial advantages, the number of companies choosing this technological alternative is on the rise and in this article we will delve into the strategic value that these custom software solutions can bring to your business.

## Custom software in today's context

Custom software, also known as bespoke software, is currently used for a variety of business purposes such as enterprise resource management (ERP), customer relationship management (CRM), project management (PM), inventory management (IM) and other operational processes critical to profitability.
Because it is custom-built, this software is designed to be integrated into your company's existing systems and can also be scaled to meet other future needs as your company grows.
In turn, this type of software is usually deployed by hiring an external professional team specialized in custom development. But it can also be developed internally by your company's IT team.

## What are the advantages of custom software?

At a business level, custom software has outstanding features compared to the commercial software you find in the market. In our experience we can highlight that:

### **It is able to meet your company's specific requirements**

Custom software is perfectly adapted to the unique needs and requirements you may have in your company. This means that in its creation you will be able to incorporate specific functionalities with the objective of improving the processes within your company, which will result in greater efficiency and productivity in the deployment areas.

### **Benefit from greater efficiency**

This software can be adapted to the specific workflows of the company. This results in a reduction of time and resources needed to complete activities and processes for greater operational efficiency.

### **It is scalable when you need it**

It is possible to design custom software directly for scalability in order to adapt to the future needs you may have in your company. This will allow the technological solution to grow and evolve along with your business and when the time comes you will be able to save time and money thanks to the anticipation.

### **Integrates with your company's existing systems**

The customized software integrates seamlessly with your company's existing systems to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of corporate, industrial and commercial activities and processes.

### **Your creation generates intellectual property**

The company that creates custom software or hires another to create it can own the intellectual property rights of the same, which will give you greater control and flexibility over this development from its source code.

### **Customized support and maintenance**

Generally this software is created to be compatible with your company's technological environment and this naturally facilitates its support and maintenance.

## How to recognize when your company needs a customized software solution?

Your company should consider creating custom software when the software available on the market cannot meet the specific needs of your operation or cannot be properly integrated with your existing systems.
Here are some factors that can help you identify when to consider custom software development for your company:

**Unique business processes**: If your company has very unique business processes which cannot be addressed with commercial software, custom software development is your only option.

**Integration with existing systems**: If your company has existing systems that cannot be properly coordinated with each other with commercial software, custom software development will be your best option.

**Need for scalability**: If your company is projecting significant growth in the future, commercial software may not be sufficient to meet your future business needs.

**Security requirements**: If your company handles sensitive information or critical data, custom software development is crucial to ensure adequate security and protection.

**Market competition**: If your company operates in a highly competitive market, custom software development can give you a unique competitive advantage.

## Can customized software improve your company's competitiveness?

Yes, thanks to custom software you can improve your company's competitiveness in the following areas:

### Process automation:

This will allow your company to operate more efficiently and thus provide higher quality services or products to your customers.

### Market changes:

The software will improve your company's flexibility and this can allow you to quickly adapt to changes in your market, your customers' needs and the recognition of business opportunities.

### Strategic planning:

Custom software can be designed to easily scale as your business grows and evolves over time. This way you can take advantage of new market opportunities and expand your business reach and presence.
