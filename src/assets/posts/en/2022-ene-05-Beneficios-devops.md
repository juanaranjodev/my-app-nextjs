There is a methodology in software development whose results continue to be proven year after year and that seems to be the recipe for success in the development of digital projects for companies, we are talking about DevOps. Some time ago, we told you about [the importance of Agile SCRUM and how it revolutionized the IT industry](https://www.dreamcodesoft.com/en/blog/how-scrum-transformed-it-industry), today we want to delve a little into DevOps, a methodology as successful as SCRUM that you have to know.

The term DevOps comes from the combination of "development" and "operations" and as a methodology it defines the combination of people, processes and technology to deliver continuous value to customers. In this sense, the DevOps culture or methodology means that there are no isolated roles and, on the contrary, a value chain is built that integrates different areas (development, IT operations, quality engineering and security), which coordinate and collaborate together to produce high quality products. By adopting a DevOps culture along with the practices and tools it promotes, teams can meet the needs of their customers, increase confidence in the applications they build, and achieve business goals in less time.

Now, in a technological and corporate ecosystem as fast as the one we live in today, DevOps becomes the perfect tool for teams to function and operate as one and everyone can participate in each stage of the lifecycle of the application and its infrastructure in order to react quickly to business needs and to any eventuality that may arise during product development.

## CUSTOMER AND END-USER PERCEPTION

One of the main advantages of the DevOps methodology is that, due to its cross-cutting workflow throughout the entire programming process, its implementation generates a sense of real-time monitoring, process control and, ultimately, great customer satisfaction, since we are dealing with an efficient, transparent, moldable and agile service that is delivered in a short range of time and with superior quality. In addition to this, organizations have the advantage that the end user is always at the center of the development and, therefore, iterations, adjustments and tests guide the team and are the raw material to reach the desired product.

The usability, key data and perspective of both the customer and the end user (their interests and preferences, daily routines, etc.) are the data on which the DevOps methodology is based and which directs the work with the objective of solving real needs and delivering products that meet everyone's expectations.

While the culture, the user and their needs must be taken into account when establishing a workflow and a final product, the programmer or organization that is developing software must also rely on the four fundamental bases that this methodology employs to ensure the highest quality standards in their deliverables. Below, we present each of them together with their importance and benefits for the technological projects of the companies.

## PHASE #1: PLANNING

When conceiving the idea of a product, it is necessary to plan and establish phases that define and describe the characteristics and functionality of the applications and systems to be created. This planning includes the code writing stage, testing and review of the code, integration and construction by team members. DevOps seeks to solve problems and add functionalities very quickly while maintaining the quality and stability of the final product.

In this phase, creating backlogs, tracking bugs, managing agile software development with Scrum, using Kanban boards and visualizing progress are just some of the ways DevOps teams plan with agility and transparency. Each team can integrate the work and planning tools with which they feel comfortable as long as a model that is open to all and internalized by each of the areas that will work on the project is guaranteed.

## PHASE #2: DEVELOPMENT AND AUTOMATION

The development phase includes all aspects of programming (writing code, iterating, reviewing and integrating code by team members) and compiling the resulting code into objects that can be used in different environments. DevOps teams strive to implement innovations quickly without sacrificing quality, stability or productivity. To achieve this, they use highly productive tools, automate daily and manual steps, and iterate code in small steps through automated testing and continuous integration.

It is this automation that saves time in the execution of mechanical, usually manual, tasks using specialized systems within the development process. Tasks such as compiling and testing software components and publishing the application to end-user environments are some examples of automated tasks.

But what does it all mean? In a nutshell, a visible gain in process. By enabling standardization, risks associated with manual processes can be prevented. Here are some of the key DevOps tasks that benefit most from automation:

- In code development, automation allows developers to optimize time and thus simplify a project's tasks according to their complexity.
- In terms of visibility, teams can control all changes that arise from the code, troubleshoot issues, and continuously track bugs as they arise.
- The monitoring of metrics and large amounts of information is delivered through an automated report. A support that facilitates the compression of information for companies and saves valuable time in the analysis of big data.

In the development phase, automation becomes necessary and must be employed after due prioritization of events, identification of the root problem within the source code and a proactive methodology full of precision and agility to employ resources in the most efficient way possible.

## PHASE #3 DELIVERY

In this phase of the DevOps methodology, feedback is integrated into the workflow. This means the measurement of everything that moves in the production line and its subsequent analysis with all team members, to finally move to the delivery of the software to the customer or end user.

In the delivery phase, the teams define a release management process with clear manual approval phases. They also set up automatic gates that move applications from one phase to the next until they are available to customers. Automating these processes makes them controlled, scalable and repeatable. In this way, DevOps teams can deliver with ease, confidence and peace of mind. It is important to remember that the faster you release new features and adjust bugs, the faster you respond to customer needs.

## PHASE #4 OPERATION

Due planning has already been followed, processes have been automated, and the software has been delivered based on feedback and agility, it is now time to enter the operation phase. This phase includes maintaining and monitoring applications and troubleshooting potential issues in production environments once they have been delivered. DevOps teams seek to identify issues before they affect the user experience and mitigate them quickly when they occur. Once the customer or end user has the product at their disposal, the team begins to perform a complete surveillance of its functionality through actionable alerts and full visibility into the applications and system to monitor that what was planned, developed and delivered is working as expected.
